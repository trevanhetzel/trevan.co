I’m pretty pumped to say that an article I wrote for Smashing Magazine went live this morning. Smashing approached me to write on the topic of selling “value” to small-town clients and of course I couldn’t turn them down. I’m not as involved in selling to clients as I was the past few years, but I hope that the things I learned can help a few other folks out too.
