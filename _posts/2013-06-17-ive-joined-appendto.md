I’m excited to announce that I’ve joined the solutions delivery team at [appendTo](http://appendto.com) full-time as a visual design engineer. I’ll be working side by side with some of the most talented developers in the industry developing responsive websites for some pretty well-known companies.

It’s been a heck of a 2.5-year ride for Hetzel Creative, but I’m putting my own client work to the side to focus on improving as a developer and learning from the brightest in the industry. I’m not “closing” Hetzel Creative, as I’ll still take care of my existing clients, but I won’t be taking on much more work for a while. I might fancy a small side client project here and there, but definitely only one at a time. My energy is going to be focused on the projects at appendTo and hopefully on finishing up [Sidecar](http://sidecarhq.com) on my now free nights &amp; weekends.

This career move is bittersweet in a way, having spent a couple years building my own business and all, but it’s the right decision for me both personally (my wife and I can finally enjoy some consistency, especially with the purchase of our new house!) and professionally, and I can’t imagine a better company to work for than the completely distributed appendTo.

Thank you to everyone who has supported my growth as a professional over the past few years, and I can’t wait to share my experiences at appendTo! Wish me luck 🙂
