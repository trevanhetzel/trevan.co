I’ve open sourced a little jQuery plugin I wrote recently for use on a couple client projects. It’s an image carousel with lightbox-esque image enlargement. The demo, JavaScript file and instructions are on GitHub: https://github.com/trevanhetzel/slidebox/.

## Features

**The current feature set includes:**

- Sliding carousel
- Prev/Next buttons &amp; keyboard arrow carousel controls
- Lightbox-like image enlargement
- Image captions
- Barebones styling to make it super easy to insert into your own design

It’s pretty simple and straightforward to plug in to a project, and the styling has been left to a minimum. Again, instructions are in the README on GitHub.

## What it looks like

Out of the box, here’s what the carousel looks like:

And when an image is enlarged:

So that’s it for now! I’m sure I’ll be adding more features as projects and needs arise. And if you’d like to see anything added or have questions, just comment below.
