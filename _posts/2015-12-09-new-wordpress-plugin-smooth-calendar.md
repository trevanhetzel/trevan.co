I’m excited to announce that my first ever WordPress plugin is now live on [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/smooth-calendar/)! It’s called Smooth Calendar and it’s the smoothest calendar plugin you’ll ever use (see what I did there?).

I built the calendar a while back for a client and just got around to polishing it up to make it public. It’s built using the [WP REST API](http://v2.wp-api.org/), it’s responsive and it…well it just works. As a theme developer myself, I made sure that Smooth Calendar is as extendable as possible and specifically kept the styling to a minimum. That makes it a pretty good choice for developers to use on client sites to keep it in line with their theme.

You can see all the features, along with screenshots, either on the [WordPress plugin page](http://wordpress.org/plugins/smooth-calendar/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/trevanhetzel/smooth-calendar) (pull requests and issues are welcome there). I have an article in the works about releasing your first WordPress plugin, so follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trevanhetzel) if you’re interested in hearing about the nitty gritty details.
