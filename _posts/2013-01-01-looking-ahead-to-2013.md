There have been a fair share of “year in review” posts popping up on blogs lately, and while I do think it’s important to reflect on the successes and failures of this past year, I’m going to instead focus on what’s to come. 2012 was indeed a great year for me personally and professionally. I learned a lot, laughed a lot, *tripled* Hetzel Creative’s revenue, made some great new relationships and more, but **here’s what I’m going to do in 2013**:

- Launch at least one SaaS that brings in recurring revenue
- Bring in at least $5k/month through recurring revenue, whether that be through one of the aforementioned SaaS applications or elsewhere
- Increase my Ruby on Rails knowledge and become a better programmer in general
- Secure at least one $20k (or more) web development contract for Hetzel Creative
- Offload more of the “work” I do for Hetzel Creative to my team (which I will be expanding in 2013) so I can focus on new business and business development
- Win the 200A class at the local Bartlett enduro
- Travel to a foreign country
- Be more fully engaged when spending time with Katie and Ryder
- Get started in investing and possibly trading stocks
- Store at least $10,000 away to buy a house
- Read a book a week
- Drink alcohol no more than twice a month
- Redesign an award winning HetzelCreative.com
- Get down to 12% body fat

I’m ready to cross off all of these and more (opportunities always arise in the most unexpected of ways!) starting today. Join me this year as we tackle the world!
