Check out my second ever WordPress plugin, Smooth Directory, now live on [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/smooth-directory/)! Iâ€™ve kind of been developing this business directory plugin alongside the Smooth Calendar plugin I launched yesterday, working on the same client project. Smooth Directory solved my needs for a simple business directory, so hopefully it can solve yours as well.

Full details are available on the WordPress plugin page or on GitHub, but the quick rundown is that itâ€™s a very simple responsive plugin that outputs a directory of businesses. Each business has optional fields that can be populated, including an image (perfect for company logos). Like Smooth Calendar, this plugin is built using a custom post type, which makes editing and adding businesses a breeze for clients.
