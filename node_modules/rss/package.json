It can include html.',\n        url: 'http://example.com/article4?this&that', // link to the item\n        guid: '1123', // optional - defaults to url\n        categories: ['Category 1','Category 2','Category 3','Category 4'], // optional - array of item categories\n        author: 'Guest Author', // optional - defaults to feed author property\n        date: 'May 27, 2012' // any format that js Date can parse.\n        enclosure : {url:'...', file:'path-to-file'} // optional\n    });\n\n    // cache the xml\n    var xml = feed.xml();\n\n### Feed Options\n\n * _title_ <string> Title of your site or feed\n * _description_ <string> Optional. Short description of the feed.\n * _feed_url_ <url> Url to the rss feed.\n * _site_url_ <url> Url to the site that the feed is for.\n * _image_url_ <url> Optional. Small image for feed readers to use.\n * _docs_ <url> Optional. Url to documentation on this feed.\n * _author_ <string> Who owns this feed.\n * _managingEditor_ <string> Optional. Who manages content in this feed.\n * _webMaster_ <string> Optional. Who manages feed availability and technical support.\n * _copyright_ <string> Optional. Copyright information for this feed.\n * _language_ <string> Optional. The language of the content of this feed.\n * _categories_ <array> Optional. One or more categories this feed belongs to.\n * _pubDate_ <Date object or date string> Optional. The publication date for content in the feed\n * _ttl_ <int> Optional. Number of minutes feed can be cached before refreshing from source.\n\n### Item Options\n\nIn RSS an item can be used for a blog entry, project update, log entry, etc.  Your rss feed\nan have any number of items. Ten to tenty is usually good.\n\n * _title_ <string> Title of this particular item.\n * _description_ <string> Content for the item.  Can contain html but link and image urls must include the server name.\n (Note: I might change this to content in the next release.)\n * _url_ <url> Url to the item. This could be a blog entry.\n * _guid_ <unique string> A unique string feed readers use to know if an item is new or has already been seen.\n If you use a guid never change it.  If you don't provide a guid then your item urls must\n be unique.\n * _categories_ <array> Optional. If provided, each array item will be added as a category element\n * _author_ <string> Optional.  If included it is the name of the item's creator.\n If not provided the item author will be the same as the feed author.  This is typical\n except on multi-author blogs.\n * _date_ <Date object or date string> The date and time of when the item was created.  Feed\n readers use this to determine the sort order. Some readers will also use it to determine\n if the content should be presented as unread.\n\n### Methods\n\n * _item(item_options)_ - add an rss item, article, entry etc.\n * _xml([indent])_ - return the xml.  If you pass in true it will use four spaces for indenting. If you prefer\n tabs use \\t instead of true.\n\n## Notes\n * You do not need to escape anything. This module will escape characters when necessary.\n * This module is very fast but you might as well cache the output of xml() and serve\n it until something changes.\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions to the project are welcome.
