Bookshelf is a node.js ORM with support for postgreSQL, mySQL, and SQLite3.
It is built atop the <a href="http://knexjs.org">Knex Query Builder</a>, 
and is strongly influenced by the Model and Collection foundations of Backbone.js.
It features transaction support, one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relations.
