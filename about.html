  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>Hey, I'm Trevan (pronounced as if the A was an I). Professionally, I design and build websites and apps. I love to work with scrappy teams and businesses to build out ideas from the ground up and have a penchant for making sure they look and feel really good. I'm always learning new tech, but I have the most fun with JavaScript, React, Vue, CSS, Ruby (especially on Rails), PHP, and WordPress, depending on the occasion.</p>

  <p>After starting my career helping small businesses get online and then being involved in fast growing startups, I've found a home working with free speech freedom loving small companies. In 2021, I played a key role in rebuilding <a href="https://parler.com/" target="_blank">Parler</a> after it was deplatformed. I now work on <a href="https://truthsocial.com">Truth Social</a>, where we build great software to promote open and free global conversation.</p>

  <h2>Consulting</h2>

  <p>Since 2008, I've operated a small consulting business where I build and maintain websites for businesses and organizations called <a href="https://hetzelcreative.com" target="_blank">Hetzel Creative</a>. I've gotten to build some pretty cool projects over the years, like Rent Like A Champion where I got to be featured on Shark Tank after their investment from Mark Cuban and Chris Sacca! Bloomberg, Zumba, Celebrity Cruises and several other large brands had a lot of their website's code written by me too.</p>

  <p>I'm always open to discussing how I can help others have a solid web presence. Contact me if you need a website or app built, modified, or kept updated and I'll see what I can do!</p>

  <h2>Family and fun</h2>

  <p>While code is fun, it doesn't compare to my love for life, family, and hobbies! I have the coolest wife and two boys and we do a lot of fun things together. We recently acquired the land and home that I grew up in as a child and are working hard to build our own little homestead. I love building things both on the computer and in real life, and recently completed a full barn build on our property.</p>

  <p>When I'm not building <em>something</em> or doing chores for our barnyard animals and garden, I enjoy riding dirt bikes with my family, camping, lifting weights, reading, selling dirt bike parts on the internet, promoting races, and hanging around with my wife and boys ðŸ˜….</p>
