My work is usually done and hosted on Linux with a standard <a title=\"LAMP\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)\" target=\"_blank\">LAMP</a> stack, so using an ubuntu virtual machine lets me keep my Windows machine for gaming and allows me to develop in a comfortable environment. You can follow along with the steps below, or give me tips on what could be done better :)\r\n\r\nWarning, it is quite long! But it does cover installing the tools, setting up a LAMP stack, creating a virtual host and installing WordPress.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"install-tools\">Step 1: Install the tools</h2>\r\nDownload and install VMWare Player: <a title=\"VMWare Player Download Page\" href=\"https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/5_0\" target=\"_blank\">VMWare Player Download Page</a> for running your virtual machine. It's probably worth noting that we're only going to get a terminal interface, not a GUI for the VM (I find this suits my needs perfectly).\r\n\r\nNow for our virtual machine, if you want to run Ubuntu like me, then you can download an Ubuntu image from here: <a title=\"Ubuntu Server Images for VMWare\" href=\"http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/vmware/#ubuntu12.04\" target=\"_blank\">Ubuntu Server Images for VMWare</a>. I used \"32-bit: ubuntu-server-12.04-i386.zip\" even though my computer is 64bit. I just didn't see any reason that my web server needed to be a 64 bit machine, but this should probably match whatever you use for hosting.\r\n\r\nNext, unzip the Ubuntu image and put it somewhere safe &amp; easily accessible on your hard drive. This will end up containing all your work, so really do make sure it's safe!\r\n\r\nNow for the fun part, run VMWare player. Choose \"Open a Virtual Machine\" and navigate to where you saved your Ubuntu image &amp; choose to open it. \r\n\r\nYou'll now have the options to \"Play virtual machine\" or \"Edit virtual machine settings\". You can give your new VM a better name by choosing edit, and then going to the options tab.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2473\" alt=\"VMWare Player\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/vmware.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"511\" />\r\n\r\nHit \"Play virtual machine\". <strong>Important:</strong> you will be prompted to choose between \"I moved it\" and \"I copied it\", always choose \"I moved it\" which is NOT the default option. Failure to do this will cause you problems later. You will be prompted to log in, if you downloaded the suggested Ubuntu image then use the provided username and password from the thought police site, probably something like notroot &amp; thoughtpolice.\r\n\r\nRun the following commands to get any updates. It will take a few minutes, but then you will have Ubuntu installed, up-to-date and ready to start playing with. \r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get upgrade</code>\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> throughout this tutorial, whenever you are prompted with a <kbd>[Y/n]</kbd> always type <kbd>Y</kbd>. \r\n<strong>Note:</strong> if you've not used VMWare player before - to focus the VM you click on it as you would expect, but to get out of it and get your mouse cursor back you need to press <kbd>\"CTRL + ALT\"</kbd>.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"apache\">Step 2: Install apache</h2>\r\n\r\nNext, lets turn our Ubuntu install into a working web server, by installing Apache HTTP Server:\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo apt-get install apache2</code>\r\n\r\nWe need to edit the config:\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo vim /etc/apache2/httpd.conf</code>\r\n\r\nAdd the following line to the file, which will be blank. This defines our web server as being called \"localhost\" which is the norm for local development environments.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you've not used vim on the command line to edit a file like this before, you'll need to press <kbd>\"i\"</kbd> to enter insert mode and start adding new content to the file. When you're done editing press <kbd>\"esc\"</kbd> to leave insert mode, and then type <kbd>\":\"</kbd> followed by <kbd>\"w\"</kbd> and then <kbd>\"q\"</kbd>. The <kbd>\":\"</kbd> brings up a command line and the <kbd>\"wq\"</kbd> means \"write and quit\". Press enter and the file will be saved and closed.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<code>ServerName localhost</code>\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to restart the server for our changes to take effect.\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</code>\r\n\r\nWe now have a working local web server, therefore we have files on the Ubuntu VM which are addressable via IP addresses / URLs such that they can be opened and run in a browser. Apache has created these web accessable files a new folder that will be located at <kbd>/var/www</kbd>. Let's verify that this is true.\r\n\r\nType the following into your VM:\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">ifconfig</code>\r\nYou should see something similar to the image below, you are looking for the <kbd>inet address</kbd> assigned to <kbd>eth0</kbd>, which will be the IP address you can use to access your webserver.\r\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2494\" alt=\"ifconfig\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ifconfig1.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"377\" />\r\n\r\nOpen up your favourite browser, and enter <kbd>http://#IP address here#</kbd>, for the example above it would be <kbd>http://192.168.178.129</kbd>. You should see the \"It works!\" default file from apache much like the one shown below:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/it-works1.png\" alt=\"Default apache web page\" width=\"600\" height=\"182\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2499\" />\r\n\r\nYou can verify that this is indeed fetching files from your virtual machine by making a change. Navigate to your <kbd>www</kbd> folder:\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">cd /var/www/</code>\r\n\r\nChange the owner of the default index file and then open it for editing:\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo chown www-data.www-data index.html\r\nsudo vim index.html</code>\r\n\r\nMake any change you like for testing.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Don't forget: <kbd>i</kbd>, <kbd>type</kbd>, <kbd>esc</kbd> + <kbd>wq</kbd></blockquote>\r\n\r\nOnce you've edited and saved the file, refresh the page in the browser to see your changes take effect.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"halfwidth alignright\">\r\n<h5>Editing the Windows hosts file</h5>\r\n<p>In XP and before, this was merely a case of opening the file, but from Vista onward it's a little trickier as you have to be administrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ul>\t\r\n<li>Browse to <kbd>C:/Windows/System32</kbd> or do a search for <kbd>notepad.exe</kbd></li>\r\n<li>Right click on <kbd>notepad.exe</kbd> and choose <kbd>\"Run as administrator\"</kbd></li>\r\n<li>Go to <kbd>File &gt; Open</kbd></li>\r\n<li>Navigate to <kbd>C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc</kbd></li>\r\n<li>Change file types <kbd>to All Files (*.*)</kbd></li>\r\n<li>Open <kbd>hosts</kbd></li>\r\n</ul></p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"localhost\">Localhost</h3>\r\n\r\nIt may be the case that you would prefer to refer to your web server by <kbd>http://localhost</kbd>, instead of having to remember the IP address. If this is the case then you need to edit your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)\" title=\"Windows hosts file\" target=\"_blank\">Windows hosts file</a> to tell Windows about the name you want to use for your IP address. See the block to the right for details of how to open up your Windows hosts file. \r\n\r\nOnce you've got it open, you need to add a line to it to map the IP address to \"localhost\" or whatever name you might like to use:\r\n\r\n<code>#IP address here# localhost</code>\r\n\r\nSo for my example I would put\r\n\r\n<code>192.168.178.129 localhost</code>\r\n \r\nOnce you've edited the file you will need to save it. It may take a few seconds to update, but you will then be able to enter <kbd>http://localhost</kbd> into your browser and get to the default page. If it doesn't seem to be updating, you may need to flush the DNS cache. This is done in Windows by running <kbd>\"ipconfig /flushdns\"</kbd> either via the \"Search programs & files\" box in the start menu, or in a <a href=\"http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1600/vista_dns_cache_flush/\" title=\"Flush Windows DNS Cache\" target=\"_blank\">command prompt</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"php-mysql\">Step 3: Installing PHP &amp; MySQL</h2>\r\n\r\nWe've got our LA part of LAMP, now it's time for the M &amp; P! This bit is super easy.\r\n\r\nTo install PHP type the following in Ubuntu:\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5\r\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</code>\r\n\r\nLet's check it works, by adding a PHP file:\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">cd /var/www/\r\nsudo vim test.php</code>\r\n\r\nAdd the following code to the file and save it:\r\n<code lang=\"php\">< ?php\r\necho \"Hello World\";</code>\r\n\r\nYou can access this file to test it via either <kbd>http://192.168.178.129/test.php</kbd> or if you set it up: <kbd>http://localhost/test.php</kbd>.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/test-php.png\" alt=\"test-php\" width=\"600\" height=\"95\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2533\" />\r\n\r\nTo get MySQL installed: \r\n\r\n</code><code lang=\"bash\">sudo apt-get install mysql-server</code>\r\n\r\nYou will be prompted to set and confirm the password for your MySQL admin user. \r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo apt-get install php5-mysql</code>\r\n\r\nYou can test that MySQL is installed correctly by playing around with the MySQL admin (you'll be prompted for the password you just setup):\r\n\r\n<code>mysql -u root -p</code>\r\n\r\nExit mysql by typing \"quit\".\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"samba\">Step 4: install and setup samba</h2>\r\n\r\nSamba is what makes using a Linux VM as a development environment really simple. It's a little fiddly to setup, but once it is done you will be able to edit the files in your <kbd>/var/www/</kbd> folder directly through Windows, using any IDE you choose. Let's get started...\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo apt-get install samba samba-common</code>\r\n\r\nAdd your user to samba (if you used the image suggested, this will be \"notroot\"):\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo smbpasswd -a #your user#</code>\r\n\r\nEnter your password for your user, then we need to backup and edit our config for Samba so it's safe to edit:\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">cd /etc/samba\r\nsudo cp smb.conf smb.conf.bak</code>\r\n\r\nOpen the file for editing\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo vim smb.conf</code>\r\n\r\nYou need to make the following changes (use the arrow keys to scroll):\r\n\r\nIn the \"Authentication section, uncomment (remove the hash / semi-colon) from the line\r\n\r\n<code>security = user</code>\r\n\r\nThen at the very bottom of the file, add the following and save the file:\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"ini\">\r\n[www]\r\ncomment = Web Root Dir\r\npath = /var/www/\r\nbrowsable = yes\r\nread only = no\r\nwritable = yes\r\nvalid users = notroot, www-data\r\nwrite list = notroot, www-data\r\nread list = notroot, www-data\r\nforce user = www-data\r\nforce group = www-data\r\npublic = no\r\nwritable = yes\r\nprintable = no\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNote that the user list should be your user (notroot if you are using the recommended Ubuntu image) and www-data.\r\n\r\nFinally, restart samba:\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo /etc/init.d/smbd restart</code>\r\n\r\nNow we should be able to connect via Windows. Open up a Windows Explorer Instance and navigate to <kbd>\"Computer\"</kbd>. At the top you should see a button which reads \"Map network drive\". Select this and in the dialog that appears, choose a letter to map to, and then enter either localhost or the ip address of your web server as you found it earlier in the following format:\r\n\r\n<code>\\\\localhost\\www\\</code>\r\n<code>\\\\#IP address#\\www\\</code>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/samba-connect.png\" alt=\"Connect to your web server in Windows via Samba\" width=\"600\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2544\" />\r\n\r\nPress \"Finish\", you'll be prompted for your username and password again, enter it and you should see the files <kbd>index.html</kbd> and <kbd>test.php</kbd> that are in your <kbd>/var/www/</kbd> folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to be able to login via PuTTY for a slightly nicer terminal, run the following.\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code>\r\n\r\nNow in PuTTY you should be able to connect to your web server's IP address and login with your username and password.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"wordpress\">Step 5: Installing WordPress on a virtual host</h2>\r\n\r\nNow that we have our LAMP stack all setup, and we have access to edit our files, we're going to use it to do something interesting.\r\n\r\nFirst we need to set up a folder structure which the WordPress files will live in, which should look like <kbd>/var/www/wordpress/public_html</kbd>. You can either create these on the command line:\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">\r\ncd /var/www/\r\nsudo mkdir wordpress\r\ncd wordpress\r\nsudo mkdir public_html\r\ncd ../\r\nsudo chown -R www-data.www-data ./\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOr now that Samba is setup and working, just create the folders in Windows.\r\n\r\nWith the folders created, setup a virtual host by creating a new vhost file:\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/wordpress</code>\r\n\r\nAdd the following to the file:\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"ini\">\r\n<virtualhost *:80>\r\n  ServerName wordpress.dev\r\n  DocumentRoot /var/www/wordpress/public_html\r\n  DirectoryIndex index.php\r\n</virtualhost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nSave the file. We need to enable our new vhost and then restart apache:\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">\r\nsudo a2ensite wordpress\r\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nSo that we can access it in the browser, we need to add the new ServerName as a host to the Windows hosts file (see the <a href=\"#localhost\" title=\"Localhost\">localhost</a> section above).\r\n\r\nIf you added localhost to it earlier, then change the line to look like:\r\n<code>#IP address# localhost wordpress.dev</code>\r\n\r\nOtherwise just add the line: \r\n<code>#IP address# wordpress.dev</code>\r\n\r\nGo to <kbd>http://wordpress.dev</kbd> in your favourite browser, and you should get an \"It works!\" page again. <strong>Note:</strong> I like to use the fake TLD .dev to remind myself when I'm on the development version of a site, other people prefer to use a subdomain of the correct domain.\r\n\r\nNow for WordPress. Download WordPress from <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\" title=\"WordPress\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.org</a> and extract the files.\r\nOpen the folders until you get to the base of WordPress where you can see the <kbd>\"wp-admin\"</kbd> folder then copy all of the present files & folders into the <kbd>/var/www/wordpress/public_html</kbd> folder using windows explorer. \r\n\r\nOur final piece of preparation is to create a database via the MysQL admin client. In VMWare type the following: \r\n<code lang=\"ini\">\r\nmysql -u root -p\r\nCREATE DATABASE wordpressdb;\r\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpressdb.* TO \"wordpressdb\"@\"localhost\" IDENTIFIED BY \"wordpressdbuser\";\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNow we have everything we need, go back to <kbd>http://wordpress.dev</kbd> in your browser and you should see the install screen for WordPress.\r\n\r\nFollow the on-screen install instructions providing the MySQL database details you setup above.\r\n\r\nFinally, we're done! We've got a working web server which is running a virtual host with a WordPress install. Setting up a virtual host for any other purpose is much the same as for WordPress - you need the folders first, then a vhost file, you enable your vhost,restart apache and finally add the new name to your Windows hosts file. \r\n\r\nHopefully this has been useful, it only covers the basics of getting from A to B so there are many, many other configuration options to play with and packages to install depending on what you want to do. It's also not been secured, I do not recommend using these settings for configuring a production server.\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/serverguide/httpd.html\">HTTPD</a> - ubuntu help</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.unixmen.com/howto-install-amp-and-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu/\">How to install LAMP and PHPMyAdmin on Ubuntu</a> - Unixmen</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/ubuntu-12-04-lts-precise-pangolin-file-sharing-with-samba/\">File sharing with samba</a> - SitePoint</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts\">How to set up apache virtual hosts on ubuntu 12 04 lts</a> - digitalocean</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Using_the_MySQL_Client\">Installing WordPress using the MySQL Client</a> - WordPress Codex</li>\r\n</ul>","html":"<p>Recently, I went through the process of setting up a new development environment on Windows for my playground projects at home. My work is usually done and hosted on Linux with a standard <a title=\"LAMP\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)\" target=\"_blank\">LAMP</a> stack, so using an ubuntu virtual machine lets me keep my Windows machine for gaming and allows me to develop in a comfortable environment. You can follow along with the steps below, or give me tips on what could be done better :)</p>\n\n<p>Warning, it is quite long! But it does cover installing the tools, setting up a LAMP stack, creating a virtual host and installing WordPress.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"install-tools\">Step 1: Install the tools</h2>  \n\n<p>Download and install VMWare Player: <a title=\"VMWare Player Download Page\" href=\"https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/5_0\" target=\"_blank\">VMWare Player Download Page</a> for running your virtual machine. It's probably worth noting that we're only going to get a terminal interface, not a GUI for the VM (I find this suits my needs perfectly).</p>\n\n<p>Now for our virtual machine, if you want to run Ubuntu like me, then you can download an Ubuntu image from here: <a title=\"Ubuntu Server Images for VMWare\" href=\"http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/vmware/#ubuntu12.04\" target=\"_blank\">Ubuntu Server Images for VMWare</a>. I used \"32-bit: ubuntu-server-12.04-i386.zip\" even though my computer is 64bit. I just didn't see any reason that my web server needed to be a 64 bit machine, but this should probably match whatever you use for hosting.</p>\n\n<p>Next, unzip the Ubuntu image and put it somewhere safe &amp; easily accessible on your hard drive. This will end up containing all your work, so really do make sure it's safe!</p>\n\n<p>Now for the fun part, run VMWare player. Choose \"Open a Virtual Machine\" and navigate to where you saved your Ubuntu image &amp; choose to open it. </p>\n\n<p>You'll now have the options to \"Play virtual machine\" or \"Edit virtual machine settings\". You can give your new VM a better name by choosing edit, and then going to the options tab.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2473\" alt=\"VMWare Player\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/vmware.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"511\" /></p>\n\n<p>Hit \"Play virtual machine\". <strong>Important:</strong> you will be prompted to choose between \"I moved it\" and \"I copied it\", always choose \"I moved it\" which is NOT the default option. Failure to do this will cause you problems later. You will be prompted to log in, if you downloaded the suggested Ubuntu image then use the provided username and password from the thought police site, probably something like notroot &amp; thoughtpolice.</p>\n\n<p>Run the following commands to get any updates. It will take a few minutes, but then you will have Ubuntu installed, up-to-date and ready to start playing with. </p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"bash\">sudo apt-get update <br />\nsudo apt-get upgrade</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> throughout this tutorial, whenever you are prompted with a <kbd>[Y/n]</kbd> always type <kbd>Y</kbd>. <br />\n<strong>Note:</strong> if you've not used VMWare player before - to focus the VM you click on it as you would expect, but to get out of it and get your mouse cursor back you need to press <kbd>\"CTRL + ALT\"</kbd>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"apache\">Step 2: Install apache</h2>\n\n<p>Next, lets turn our Ubuntu install into a working web server, by installing Apache HTTP Server: <br />\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo apt-get install apache2</code></p>\n\n<p>We need to edit the config: <br />\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo vim /etc/apache2/httpd.conf</code></p>\n\n<p>Add the following line to the file, which will be blank. This defines our web server as being called \"localhost\" which is the norm for local development environments.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you've not used vim on the command line to edit a file like this before, you'll need to press <kbd>\"i\"</kbd> to enter insert mode and start adding new content to the file. When you're done editing press <kbd>\"esc\"</kbd> to leave insert mode, and then type <kbd>\":\"</kbd> followed by <kbd>\"w\"</kbd> and then <kbd>\"q\"</kbd>. The <kbd>\":\"</kbd> brings up a command line and the <kbd>\"wq\"</kbd> means \"write and quit\". Press enter and the file will be saved and closed.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><code>ServerName localhost</code></p>\n\n<p>Finally, we need to restart the server for our changes to take effect.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"bash\">sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</code></p>\n\n<p>We now have a working local web server, therefore we have files on the Ubuntu VM which are addressable via IP addresses / URLs such that they can be opened and run in a browser. Apache has created these web accessable files a new folder that will be located at <kbd>/var/www</kbd>. Let's verify that this is true.</p>\n\n<p>Type the following into your VM: <br />\n<code lang=\"bash\">ifconfig</code> <br />\nYou should see something similar to the image below, you are looking for the <kbd>inet address</kbd> assigned to <kbd>eth0</kbd>, which will be the IP address you can use to access your webserver. <br />\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2494\" alt=\"ifconfig\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ifconfig1.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"377\" /></p>\n\n<p>Open up your favourite browser, and enter <kbd><a href='http://#IP'>http://#IP</a> address here#</kbd>, for the example above it would be <kbd><a href='http://192.168.178.129'>http://192.168.178.129</a></kbd>. You should see the \"It works!\" default file from apache much like the one shown below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/it-works1.png\" alt=\"Default apache web page\" width=\"600\" height=\"182\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2499\" /></p>\n\n<p>You can verify that this is indeed fetching files from your virtual machine by making a change. Navigate to your <kbd>www</kbd> folder: <br />\n<code lang=\"bash\">cd /var/www/</code></p>\n\n<p>Change the owner of the default index file and then open it for editing: <br />\n<code lang=\"bash\">sudo chown www-data.www-data index.html <br />\nsudo vim index.html</code></p>\n\n<p>Make any change you like for testing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Don't forget: <kbd>i</kbd>, <kbd>type</kbd>, <kbd>esc</kbd> + <kbd>wq</kbd></blockquote>\n\n<p>Once you've edited and saved the file, refresh the page in the browser to see your changes take effect.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"halfwidth alignright\">  \n<h5>Editing the Windows hosts file</h5>  \n<p>In XP and before, this was merely a case of opening the file, but from Vista onward it's a little trickier as you have to be administrator.</p>\n\n<p><ul>  \n<li>Browse to <kbd>C:/Windows/System32</kbd> or do a search for <kbd>notepad.exe</kbd></li>  \n<li>Right click on <kbd>notepad.exe</kbd> and choose <kbd>\"Run as administrator\"</kbd></li>  \n<li>Go to <kbd>File &gt; Open</kbd></li>  \n<li>Navigate to <kbd>C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc</kbd></li>  \n<li>Change file types <kbd>to All Files (*.*)</kbd></li>  \n<li>Open <kbd>hosts</kbd></li>  \n</ul></p></blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"localhost\">Localhost</h3>\n\n<p>It may be the case that you would prefer to refer to your web server by <kbd><a href='http://localhost'>http://localhost</a></kbd>, instead of having to remember the IP address. If this is the case then you need to edit your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)\" title=\"Windows hosts file\" target=\"_blank\">Windows hosts file</a> to tell Windows about the name you want to use for your IP address. See the block to the right for details of how to open up your Windows hosts file. </p>\n\n<p>Once you've got it open, you need to add a line to it to map the IP address to \"localhost\" or whatever name you might like to use:</p>\n\n<p><code>#IP address here# localhost</code></p>\n\n<p>So for my example I would put</p>\n\n<p><code>192.168.178.129 localhost</code></p>\n\n<p>Once you've edited the file you will need to save it. It may take a few seconds to update, but you will then be able to enter <kbd><a href='http://localhost'>http://localhost</a></kbd> into your browser and get to the default page. If it doesn't seem to be updating, you may need to flush the DNS cache. This is done in Windows by running <kbd>\"ipconfig /flushdns\"</kbd> either via the \"Search programs &amp; files\" box in the start menu, or in a <a href=\"http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1600/vista_dns_cache_flush/\" title=\"Flush Windows DNS Cache\" target=\"_blank\">command prompt</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"php-mysql\">Step 3: Installing PHP &amp; MySQL</h2>\n\n<p>We've got our LA part of LAMP, now it's time for the M &amp; P!

As our calendars tick over to a brand new year, most folk feel drawn to it as a fresh start, a simple changing of the date makes us feel like we're starting over. Combined with a break from the weekly work-eat-sleep routine and copious amounts of time with friends &amp; relatives, thoughts turn to work-life balance, evaluating what we've done with our year &amp; reflecting on what was missing.\r\n\r\nThen there's the tradition of setting a new years resolution. Usually something spur of the moment, arbitrary to measure and impossible to achieve: 'lose weight', 'quit smoking', 'do more exercise', 'drink less', 'spend more time with family', 'work less' &amp; so on.

Whilst the Christmas &amp; New Year breaks give us all plenty of time to think &amp; have our self-realisations, epiphanies & moments of sworn change, the truth is that unless you make drastic changes to your various environments, it doesn't take long before the old routines take over again, and you remember WHY you smoke/drink/never have time to cook a decent meal/have to stay late at work...again.\r\n\r\n<h3>Cause and effect</h3>\r\n\r\nI have come to believe, that if you really do want to change something about yourself, you have to look at the cause of your unwanted behaviour and importantly, WHY you want to change it. Habits are usually a coping mechanism of some sort, so either you need to remove the need to cope, or change the way you do it. But when it comes to the why, i'll bet the answer is something along the lines of social pressure from the very same society which gave life to your bad habits in the first place (cue vicious circle and nothing ever changing).\r\n\r\nHowever, once you've figured out the causes and decided whether YOU really want to change (as opposed to feeling like you should do) you'll discover you can set yourself a more realistic goal. Hopefully something along the lines of learning a new skill, or challenging yourself to make a small change. That, or you'll realise you have a much more fundamental problem to solve.\r\n\r\nThis year, I'm not setting myself a new years resolution.

Anyway, here's what I wrote, and what my friend replied with:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2337\" title=\"Facebook - why am I so tired?\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/facebook-sleep.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook - why am I so tired?\" width=\"477\" height=\"158\" />\r\n\r\nHoliday-fatigue is something I regularly battle. I always have massive plans for what I can achieve with a long weekend or a week off, but by the time I've spent a day chilling out I'm in relaxed mode and never have the impetus to do any of it. People who do a full working week and still churn out side projects at a rate of knots in their evenings and weekends have both my envy and my awe.\r\n\r\nHowever, my friend's comment made me stop and think because she believes I'm suffering sleep deprivation - this isn't something I recall ever having even hinted to her. Sure, getting up at 5:30 every morning to do a 2 hour commute means I live on the edge of getting enough sleep, but as far as I'm concerned this was something I adjusted to after about 2 months. The idea that it takes more than a few long sleeps to cancel out is also intriguing - so off I went to Wikipedia to read their article on <a title=\"Wikipedia: Sleep Deprivation\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Deprivation</a>.\r\n\r\nApparently, your brain keeps a close account of how much sleep you owe it (that's kinda freaky), and if you continue to accrue <a title=\"Wikipedia: Sleep debt\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_debt\" target=\"_blank\">sleep debt</a> (apparently that's a thing) you eventually have to pay it back - sometimes your body will steal it back through unavoidable <a title=\"Wikipedia: Microsleep\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsleep\" target=\"_blank\">microsleeps</a> or tiny naps (who hasn't had one of those at their desk after a big lunch?!). By this point, I've fallen into a Wikipedia Trap so also had to read the article on the <a title=\"Wikipedia: Hypnic Jerk\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk\" target=\"_blank\">Hypnic Jerk</a> (tee hee).\r\n\r\nAll this information on sleep is fascinating: apparently the falling dream that often accompanies a Hypnic Jerk is actually a hallucination (weird!) and also, apparently, you can determine just how sleep deprived you are by<a title=\"Wikipedia: Multiple Sleep Latency Test\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Sleep_Latency_Test\" target=\"_blank\"> timing how long it takes you to fall asleep</a> (or your \"<a title=\"Wikipedia: Sleep Latency\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_latency\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Latency</a>\"). Shockingly (to me at least) according to the sleep latency test, if you fall asleep in less than 15 minutes, you are suffering a level of sleep deprivation?!? It usually takes me 10-15 minutes if I'm comfy in my bed in a quiet, dark room, regardless of how tired I feel or how much sleep I have. Husband on the other hand struggles to sleep without a TV on - so am I not just a good go-to-sleep-er?\r\n\r\n<a title=\"About: How much sleep is enough?\" href=\"http://sleepdisorders.about.com/od/howmuchsleepdoineed/a/how_much_sleep.htm\" target=\"_blank\">The average adult requires 8 hours sleep</a> (watch it, that link is NOT from Wikipedia haha) so if I'm \"the\" average adult, and I get roughly 7.5 hours sleep a night, then each week I accrue a sleep debt of 2.5 hours. I usually also get at least one train-nap or lie in a week, gaining me back another 30 minutes and I always have a lie in (at least 10 hours) at the weekend. Therefore, if I'm \"the\" average adult - I sleep enough (although husband will tell you that I always used to be a 9 hours kinda gal).\r\n\r\nI remember a conversation I had before I started my new job where I was saying I couldn't remember the last time I didn't feel like I could fall asleep if you just gave me a pillow and some peace and quiet (this is still true). Back then I put it down to the stresses of my old job because I was commuting 10 minutes and easily getting 9 hours sleep a night. Nowadays I've a spring in my step and a smile on my face - I might not sleep but I'm much less stressed!\r\n\r\nAll this is purely academic anyway. We're all entirely different and have different needs. I'm certian that energy levels have as much to do with diet and levels of physical &amp; mental exertion as they do your sleep debt.  Who knows what we really know or understand about sleep? We know naff-all about dreams. Most adults I know complain of little other than the weather and feeling tired.\r\n\r\nSo there we go, my random Wikipedia &amp; thought trail is over. I have a cup of coffee in hand and feel more awake than I did before I wrote this... so what about you? Got any weird sleep habits?!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sleeping-kitties2.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"sleeping-kitties2\" width=\"580\" height=\"193\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2351\" />","html":"<p><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2345\" style=\"border-style: initial; border-color: initial;\" title=\"sleeping kitties\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sleeping-kitties-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"sleeping kitties\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>* Disclaimer *</em>*</strong> I am well aware that Wikipedia is not the best source of information... but you know... it's just.. there!<br /><br /> <br />\nA very dear friend of mine just posted a comment on Facebook that has prompted me to write this \"Thinking out loud\" post about my sleeping habits, which is largely an excuse for exploring wikipedia and looking at pictures of cute sleeping kitties. Anyway, here's what I wrote, and what my friend replied with:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2337\" title=\"Facebook - why am I so tired?\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/facebook-sleep.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook - why am I so tired?\" width=\"477\" height=\"158\" /></p>\n\n<p>Holiday-fatigue is something I regularly battle. I always have massive plans for what I can achieve with a long weekend or a week off, but by the time I've spent a day chilling out I'm in relaxed mode and never have the impetus to do any of it. People who do a full working week and still churn out side projects at a rate of knots in their evenings and weekends have both my envy and my awe.</p>\n\n<p>However, my friend's comment made me stop and think because she believes I'm suffering sleep deprivation - this isn't something I recall ever having even hinted to her. Sure, getting up at 5:30 every morning to do a 2 hour commute means I live on the edge of getting enough sleep, but as far as I'm concerned this was something I adjusted to after about 2 months. The idea that it takes more than a few long sleeps to cancel out is also intriguing - so off I went to Wikipedia to read their article on <a title=\"Wikipedia: Sleep Deprivation\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Deprivation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, your brain keeps a close account of how much sleep you owe it (that's kinda freaky), and if you continue to accrue <a title=\"Wikipedia: Sleep debt\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_debt\" target=\"_blank\">sleep debt</a> (apparently that's a thing) you eventually have to pay it back - sometimes your body will steal it back through unavoidable <a title=\"Wikipedia: Microsleep\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsleep\" target=\"_blank\">microsleeps</a> or tiny naps (who hasn't had one of those at their desk after a big lunch?!). By this point, I've fallen into a Wikipedia Trap so also had to read the article on the <a title=\"Wikipedia: Hypnic Jerk\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk\" target=\"_blank\">Hypnic Jerk</a> (tee hee).</p>\n\n<p>All this information on sleep is fascinating: apparently the falling dream that often accompanies a Hypnic Jerk is actually a hallucination (weird!) and also, apparently, you can determine just how sleep deprived you are by<a title=\"Wikipedia: Multiple Sleep Latency Test\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Sleep_Latency_Test\" target=\"_blank\"> timing how long it takes you to fall asleep</a> (or your \"<a title=\"Wikipedia: Sleep Latency\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_latency\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Latency</a>\"). Shockingly (to me at least) according to the sleep latency test, if you fall asleep in less than 15 minutes, you are suffering a level of sleep deprivation?!? It usually takes me 10-15 minutes if I'm comfy in my bed in a quiet, dark room, regardless of how tired I feel or how much sleep I have. Husband on the other hand struggles to sleep without a TV on - so am I not just a good go-to-sleep-er?</p>\n\n<p><a title=\"About: How much sleep is enough?\" href=\"http://sleepdisorders.about.com/od/howmuchsleepdoineed/a/how_much_sleep.htm\" target=\"_blank\">The average adult requires 8 hours sleep</a> (watch it, that link is NOT from Wikipedia haha) so if I'm \"the\" average adult, and I get roughly 7.5 hours sleep a night, then each week I accrue a sleep debt of 2.5 hours. I usually also get at least one train-nap or lie in a week, gaining me back another 30 minutes and I always have a lie in (at least 10 hours) at the weekend. Therefore, if I'm \"the\" average adult - I sleep enough (although husband will tell you that I always used to be a 9 hours kinda gal).</p>\n\n<p>I remember a conversation I had before I started my new job where I was saying I couldn't remember the last time I didn't feel like I could fall asleep if you just gave me a pillow and some peace and quiet (this is still true). Back then I put it down to the stresses of my old job because I was commuting 10 minutes and easily getting 9 hours sleep a night. Nowadays I've a spring in my step and a smile on my face - I might not sleep but I'm much less stressed!</p>\n\n<p>All this is purely academic anyway. We're all entirely different and have different needs. I'm certian that energy levels have as much to do with diet and levels of physical &amp; mental exertion as they do your sleep debt.  Who knows what we really know or understand about sleep? We know naff-all about dreams. Most adults I know complain of little other than the weather and feeling tired.</p>\n\n<p>So there we go, my random Wikipedia &amp; thought trail is over. I have a cup of coffee in hand and feel more awake than I did before I wrote this... so what about you? Got any weird sleep habits?!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sleeping-kitties2.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"sleeping-kitties2\" width=\"580\" height=\"193\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2351\" /></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1382037746377,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1382037746377,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1325093124000,"published_by":1},{"id":20,"uuid":"bd645e39-1215-494f-9b73-e1d06e6426ba","title":"How to make onBeforeUnload work","slug":"temp-slug-13","markdown":"<a href=\"http://jonstjohn.com/node/23 \" title=\"Using JQuery to Warn Users About Losing Data When Navigating Away from Form\" target=\"_blank\">http://jonstjohn.com/node/23</a>\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer\r\nReturn a string\r\n\r\nHow to turn it on/off again?\r\n\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"javascript\"]\r\nfunction setConfirmUnload(on) {\r\n     window.onbeforeunload = (on) ? unloadMessage : null;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction unloadMessage() {\r\n     return 'You have entered new data on this page.

Using it as a full stack framework however, is a different challenge all together.\r\n\r\nLet me explain the reasons why I'm investing time in ZF. If you've read this blog before you may be aware that I have a lot of experience working with the <a title=\"Symfony Framework\" href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Symfony Framework</a>, and I'm really fond of it. However after using it to write what was quite a sizeable app, I found it started to get quite slow, as well as finding the <a title=\"ORM - Object Relational Mapping\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping\" target=\"_blank\">ORMs</a> (I mostly used <a title=\"Propel ORM\" href=\"http://www.propelorm.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Propel</a>) to be quite cumbersome (I like SQL!). I often spent a long time trying to figure out how Symfony wanted me to do something and therefore the flexibility of ZF in this regard is attractive.\r\n\r\nZend Framework also seems to be more of an industry standard, where Symfony is somewhat niche. Coming from Zend and with training and qualifications available, it seems like a good tool to add to my toolbox. The added benefit is my code &amp; approach are more likely to be understood by other people quickly, so if any of my side projects ever take off they should scale easily :)\r\n\r\n<h2>Tackling the Tutorials</h2>\r\n\r\nSo on to the task of learning how to approach a site with ZF. I have two books that I've skim-read: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1933988320/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=muofer-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1933988320\">Zend Framework in Action</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0973862157/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=muofer-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0973862157\">Php|architect's Guide to Programming with Zend Framework</a> both are OK but pretty broad and don't cover key topics in much detail. I've also been through the quickstart tutorial on Zend.com and some of the more advanced stuff. It's clear that Zend Framework is a powerful tool, but mastering it is no simple task.\r\n\r\nFlexibility &amp; being able to approach problems in multiple ways was one of the attractions of Zend Framework, but I find the complete lack of even a hint at where code should go quite disconcerting. I would be happy with some suggestions and debates on best practice, but even that seems limited. Therefore I have taken to searching Google for key topics with the flag \"-site:<a href=\"http://zend.com/\" target=\"_blank\">zend.com</a>\" so that I only get results from sites other than Zend because it is top in all search results but almost never has the answer!\r\n\r\nOne of the great things about Symfony is the Askeet/Jobeet tutorial. Every version of Symfony has had an in-depth tutorial that went with it, covering each aspect of the system. This provided a great learning tool, and also a fantastic talking point for debate and spin-off tutorials which looked at areas in even more depth.\r\n\r\nIn complete contrast, the Zend Framework's own tutorials seems to be extremely lacking. Most of the documentation seems to cover only very basic examples, lacking in any real depth or clever stuff. For example the <a title=\"Learning multiuser authentication\" href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/learning.multiuser.authentication.html\" target=\"_blank\">Getting started with Zend_Auth</a> tutorial lacks CSRF protection &amp; password salting - two things that should really be \"the standard\" IMO. The following tutorial on <a title=\"Learning Multiuser Authorisation\" href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/learning.multiuser.authorization.html\" target=\"_blank\">Zend_Acl</a> is even more disappointing - it doesn't give any clue as to where any of the code should go. You're expected to know/guess or just make it up as you go.\r\n\r\n<h2>Finding an Approach for Key Concepts</h2>\r\n\r\nThere are three areas in particular which seem to be vastly under-documented / under-exampled in my opinion: Models, Access Control and Routing. I despise patterns using one model class to represent both a collection and instance of an object, which is what appears in a vast number of tutorials. ZF seems to roughly support the ActiveRecord style pattern (which I'm used to from using Propel/Doctrine) through extending its <a title=\"Zend Db Table\" href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html\" target=\"_blank\">Db_Table</a> &amp; <a title=\"Db Table Row\" href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.row.html\" target=\"_blank\">Db_Table_Row</a> classes and paired with <a title=\"Zend Db Select\" href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.select.html\" target=\"_blank\">Db_Select </a>it works as a kind of lo-fi ORM. It seems that many <a title=\"ActiveRecord does not suck\" href=\"http://karwin.blogspot.com/2008/05/activerecord-does-not-suck.html\" target=\"_blank\">Zend folk are not a fan of ActiveRecord</a>, but the main documentation barely hints at any of this, or any other potential approaches. You have to leave the main site and search various blogs to get even a whiff of any of this knowledge.\r\n\r\nEven more worrying/frustrating is the seeming lack of documentation around Access Control &amp; Routing. I'm used to these being baked-in in Symfony as both were managed via YAML config files, and the almost-comes-as-standard sfGuardPlugin provided fine grained control of users, groups and permissions. ZF provides tools, but little direction and it seems quite intensive to get either of these key parts of a web application up and running.\r\n\r\nFrustratingly, there seems to be no such obvious place to setup these vital parts of the site (does everyone end up with enormous Bootstrap files?!?). I've already mentioned the vagaries of the ACL tutorial, but routing for me is pretty fundamental. In Symfony you define your database schema (which results in a database, models &amp; forms for CRUD), then write your routes, then you write code. In ZF I've really struggled to find anything which takes the same REST API-as-standard approach to configuring routes. I know <a title=\"Building RESTful Services with Zend Framework\" href=\"http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/228-Building-RESTful-Services-with-Zend-Framework.html\" target=\"_blank\">it can be done</a>, it just doesn't seem to be a standard way of thinking about things.\r\n<h2>Zend Framework vs Symfony?</h2>\r\nWell, this turned out to be much more of a Symfony vs Zend Framework post than I intended. It also seems that all the features of Zend that I thought would make it great to use have turned out to be what makes it a pain in the arse! I know that this is partially because I've been spoiled by Symfony doing so much of the heavy lifting for me, and by its awesome documentation. I am also aware I'm trying to do ORM-y things without an ORM.

That is until you upload the code to your server and discover that someone else sharing the server's IP is very selfishly hogging all of the API requests.\r\n\r\nTwitter very helpfully allows you to authenticate your own app for your account and generate an OAuth Access token, meaning you can skip the first few steps of the OAuth process. However after much Googling, I discovered there really aren't that many examples of what to do next - they all seem to use one or another library - which seems totally unnecessary for making one request.\r\n\r\nAfter much searching, finally I found one <a href=\"http://www.godlikemouse.com/2011/04/01/twitter-oauth-php-tutorial/\" title=\"Twitter OAuth PHP Tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">awesome step-by-step tutorial</a> which explains <a href=\"http://www.godlikemouse.com/2011/04/01/twitter-oauth-php-tutorial/\" title=\"Twitter OAuth PHP Tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">the first few steps of OAuth</a> and in particular how to build the OAuth HTTP headers and OAuth signature to sign the request. So I've taken lead from here, borrowed the helper functions and signature code, and put it all together to make a signed GET request to the API and return some ACTUAL data.\r\n\r\nHere's the couple of helper functions I borrowed, the first combines the request URI and parameters into a string as required by the OAuth signature. The second one takes an array of OAuth credentials/settings and combines them into the HTTP header for use with cURL.\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\nfunction buildBaseString($baseURI, $method, $params)\r\n{\r\n    $r = array(); \r\n    ksort($params);\r\n    foreach($params as $key=>$value){\r\n        $r[] = \"$key=\" . rawurlencode($value); \r\n    }\r\n    return $method.\"&\" . rawurlencode($baseURI) . '&' . rawurlencode(implode('&', $r)); \r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction buildAuthorizationHeader($oauth)\r\n{\r\n    $r = 'Authorization: OAuth '; \r\n    $values = array(); \r\n    foreach($oauth as $key=>$value)\r\n        $values[] = \"$key=\\\"\" . rawurlencode($value) . \"\\\"\"; \r\n    $r .= implode(', ', $values); \r\n    return $r; \r\n}\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nNext you need to setup all of the OAuth credentials and settings. For Twitter, the tokens, keys and secrets you need will all be available on <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/apps\" title=\"Twitter: My Apps\" target=\"_blank\">your App page</a>. If you haven't got any Apps, you'll need to <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/apps\" title=\" Twitter: My Apps\" target=\"_blank\">create one</a>, authorise it for your account and grab an access token. \r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n$url = \"http://api.twitter.com/1/account/totals.json\";\r\n\r\n$oauth_access_token = \"YOUR TOKEN HERE\";\r\n$oauth_access_token_secret = \"YOUR TOKEN SECRET HERE\";\r\n$consumer_key = \"YOUR KEY HERE\";\r\n$consumer_secret = \"YOUR SECRET HERE\";\r\n\r\n$oauth = array( 'oauth_consumer_key' => $consumer_key,\r\n                'oauth_nonce' => time(),\r\n                'oauth_signature_method' => 'HMAC-SHA1',\r\n                'oauth_token' => $oauth_access_token,\r\n                'oauth_timestamp' => time(),\r\n                'oauth_version' => '1.0');\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nThe tricky bit, that doesn't ever seem to be explained to well, is creating the OAuth signature. For HMAC-SHA1, this boils down to the following few lines: \r\nCreate your URI base string by combining the URL you will be sending the request to with the oauth details as per the helper function. The key is the consumer secret and access token secret URL encoded and combined with an ampersand. Finally, the base url and the composite key are hashed and and base 64 encoded. Sounds really fraking complicated when you read the instructions, doesn't look so bad when it's written out in PHP.\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n$base_info = buildBaseString($url, 'GET', $oauth);\r\n$composite_key = rawurlencode($consumer_secret) . '&' . rawurlencode($oauth_access_token_secret);\r\n$oauth_signature = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha1', $base_info, $composite_key, true));\r\n$oauth['oauth_signature'] = $oauth_signature;\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nTo make the request we have to setup a HTTP header and a few other options to pass to cURL. The helper method does the hard work of creating the correct header format with the OAuth settings and then finally, it's time to make the request with cURL.\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n$header = array(buildAuthorizationHeader($oauth), 'Expect:');\r\n$options = array( CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => $header,\r\n                  CURLOPT_HEADER => false,\r\n                  CURLOPT_URL => $url,\r\n                  CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,\r\n                  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => false);\r\n\r\n$feed = curl_init();\r\ncurl_setopt_array($feed, $options);\r\n$json = curl_exec($feed);\r\ncurl_close($feed);\r\n\r\n$twitter_data = json_decode($json);\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nThis works really well if you just want to fetch data from your own account - last statuses, mentions, favourites or your stats like in the example above. It should also work with any OAuth based API which supports HMAC-SHA1 signatures (Google, LinkedIn, Vimeo, the list goes on). If the API you're working with doesn't have a neat tool for getting an access token for your account like Twitter does, you can always do the first few authentication steps by using an <a href=\"http://term.ie/oauth/example/client.php\" title=\"OAuth Online Client\" target=\"_blank\">online client</a>. Fill out your details and it will handle the first few exchanges, and once you have your access token you're free to make requests using just the 50 lines of code above, instead of requiring an OAuth library.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/twitter-oauth.zip\" onClick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/downloads/twitter-oauth-001']);\" title=\"Download the full Twitter OAuth Code Example\">Download the full Twitter OAuth Code Example</a>\r\n\r\nBig Kudos to Jason Graves (aka.

Either we have to use AJAX (which is essentially a clever hack) or we have to resort to server side technologies like cURL. This isn't the case if the \"arbitrary content\" is an image, a script, some css or audio/video in HTML5. For those we have clever HTML elements like &lt;img&gt;, &lt;script&gt; &lt;link&gt; or in HTML5 even &lt;video&gt; or &lt;audio&gt; and if you want to fetch a whole document you can use the (imo horrendous) &lt;iframe&gt; tag. Most of these use a \"src\" attribute to go off and fetch some content, check if its appropriate for the tag, and then render it appropriately.\r\n\r\nWhy can't we do that with a &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h#&gt; or &lt;div&gt; tag?\r\n\r\nImagine twitter has an additional API that just returns bits of text or HTML rather than XML/json for our hoop jumping ajax/curl type requests.\r\n\r\nOn my blog page, I could do this:\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"html\"]<div src=\"twitter.com/erisds/latest\">sorry, my latest tweet could not be loaded</div>[/cc]\r\n\r\nI could use RESTful requests directly in my page, without having to jump through hoops, without needing additional javascript &amp; serverside code. Fetching content from a URL is effectively the core function of a browser, as is handling the resulting HTML.

Or alternatively abusing this to recreate the frameset / iframe hell of the 90's. Whilst obviously this would be an issue, we've already learned the frameset lesson, and now people know how to use these tools properly (or not at all). In most cases, the request would just be replacing one that was being made some other way.\r\n\r\nAlso some people have raised the point, what would the browser do if it didn't recognise the content fetched?

If you've worked extensively with APIs, or if you've ever built a fully RESTful/MVC style PHP application, perhaps the benefits are clearer. Also if you've ever dealt with smarty or another templating language.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting doing an API call for every single variable that might go into an HTML page, but it would still be possible to massively reduce the complexity of some templating or theme systems.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Symfony there is the concept of components. These are standalone templates which might draw part of the page - for example the menu, or a sidebar. WordPress' templates &amp; business logic isn't separated in the \"MVC\" style same way, but it still has the concept of sidebars, widgets &amp; menus. These components, or separate templates, are still driven by PHP but usually are completely standalone - they work outside of the context of a page. So an archive widget is still an archive widget whether it's on page X, Y, or completely on it's own.\r\n\r\nIn Symfony, components are pulled in using a glorified PHP include. WordPress is full of \"template tag\" functions which echo HTML by default and are always available to the theme.\r\n\r\nIf we had a src attribute for all attributes we could do things like:\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"html\"]<aside src=\"/widgets/archive\">Archive Unavailable</aside>[/cc]\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"html\"]<nav src=\"/menus/main-menu\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></nav>[/cc]\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"html\"]<section src=\"/products/t-shirts/mens/\">0 products available</section>[/cc]\r\n\r\nEach time we can specify some default or placeholder content, and then rely on the browser to query the URL, and place the response into the right part of the page. All while keeping our HTML nice and clean and separating our business logic from our templates in the same way we have been separating our content &amp; styling with HTML &amp; CSS for years.\r\n\r\nFor WordPress, it wouldn't make a great deal of sense currently, because you'd effectively have to have a PHP file at the location of /widgets/archive with:\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]< ?php wp_get_archives('type=monthly'); ?>[/cc]\r\n\r\nBut MVC style applications which use routing systems with controllers already know how to handle a URL like /menus/main-menu, send it to a certain controller to do some business logic and then render a partial template. For example an e-commerce platform may already have a product controller - this would probably take a couple of arguments, go off to the database (via a model) fetch the right products based on those arguments, then do some logic before passing the data to a partial templates. \r\n\r\nSo my /products/t-shirts/mens example would send the arguments category = t-shirts, sub-category = mens to the product controller, get all the products from the database and pass the list of products to a template to render a pre-formatted list of products. This could be used anywhere a list of products is needed on the site, and could potentially be exposed to the wider internet so that other sites can show your products (think amazon affiliate programs).\r\n\r\nThe MVC pattern is widely accepted as being one of the better application patterns - partly because it encourages a RESTful / stateless system which is basically an API with templates built on top of it. More and more websites and web applications are offering APIs and it makes sense to build your application with an API and use it yourself. I can't help feeling that if we had this src functionality, this would encourage this style of programming much more and make the tendancy towards publishing an API even more widespread. \r\n\r\n(And if you want to know what's great about APIs... maybe <a href=\"http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/03/thousand-of-apis-paint-a-bright-future-for-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\">start here</a>)\r\n","html":"<p>In the middle of writing a blog post about generating placeholder text (think lipsum..coming soon) I started wondering why there is no HTML-native way to load arbitrary content into an element.</p>\n\n<p>API's and RESTful services are all over the web these days, but we continue to have to jump through hoops to access them.

After a bit of digging around, turns out the error message I got is one of a few error messages that can appear when you try to automatically update but <strong>don't have enough disk space</strong>.

Since that time, a new couple of new versions of the YUI2: Carousel widget have been released (2.8.0 and 2.8.1), and it seems my examples do not work with the updated code. This post covers the issues, the reasons why they occur and how to resolve them.\r\n\r\nIn version 2.8.0 and 2.8.1 the introduction of code for handling rows has caused a bug which means that the carousels won't display in Internet Explorer 6, 7 or 8 unless you explicitly set the width and height of the carousel elements in your CSS. If you want to use non-specific widths and heights, then you need to either use version 2.7.0 OR use <a href='http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yui_carousel_2.8.1_fixed.js.zip' onClick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/downloads/yui2_carousel_2.8.1_fixed']);\">my fixed version of 2.8.1</a>. The 2.8.* versions of the YUI2 Carousel also fix an issue with the positioning of elements in the carousel going wrong when zoomed in or out in Safari and other WebKit browsers such as Google Chrome so it's a good idea to use the latest version if you can.\r\n\r\nAlso, to use version 2.8.* you need to use slightly different CSS to that in my two examples. Details of which are coming soon, along with updated tutorials and part 3.\r\n\r\n<h2>Fixing version 2.8.1</h2>\r\nI have used the YUI carousel in several projects, some of which both require the WebKit fix and to use carousels which vary in width and height dynamically. Therefore I have identified a fix for version 2.8.1.\r\n\r\nTo apply the fix, you will need to download the latest release of the carousel code:\r\n(Follow the link below, save the page as carousel.js inside your project and link to the file)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.8.1/build/carousel/carousel.js\">http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.8.1/build/carousel/carousel.js</a>\r\n\r\nThen locate and change lines 3602-3608:\r\n[cc lang=\"javascript\"]\r\n} else {\r\n  if(rows) {\r\n    size = getCarouselItemSize.call(carousel, \"height\");\r\n    size = size * rows;\r\n    Dom.setStyle(carousel._carouselEl, \"height\", size + \"px\");\r\n  }\r\n}[/cc]\r\n\r\nTo the following:\r\n[cc lang=\"javascript\"]\r\n} else {\r\n  size = getCarouselItemSize.call(carousel, \"height\");\r\n  \r\n  if(rows) {\r\n    size = size * rows;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  Dom.setStyle(carousel._carouselEl, \"height\", size + \"px\");\r\n}[/cc]\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can download my fixed version of the YUI Carousel here: <a href='http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yui_carousel_2.8.1_fixed.js.zip' onClick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/downloads/yui2_carousel_2.8.1_fixed']);\">YUI2 Carousel 2.8.1 fixed [ZIP File]</a>\r\n\r\nHopefully this fixes the issues that many people have been having with the YUI Carousel in Internet Explorer. Also, this fixes a major roadblock in my release of part 3 of my YUI Carousel custom navigation series, so I hope to release the final part very soon.\r\n\r\n","html":"<p>Last year I published two parts of a three part tutorial (doh) on the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/carousel/\">YUI2 Carousel Widget</a> which worked with YUI Carousel 2.7.0. Since that time, a new couple of new versions of the YUI2: Carousel widget have been released (2.8.0 and 2.8.1), and it seems my examples do not work with the updated code. This post covers the issues, the reasons why they occur and how to resolve them.</p>\n\n<p>In version 2.8.0 and 2.8.1 the introduction of code for handling rows has caused a bug which means that the carousels won't display in Internet Explorer 6, 7 or 8 unless you explicitly set the width and height of the carousel elements in your CSS. If you want to use non-specific widths and heights, then you need to either use version 2.7.0 OR use <a href='http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yui_carousel_2.8.1_fixed.js.zip' onClick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/downloads/yui2_carousel_2.8.1_fixed']);\">my fixed version of 2.8.1</a>.

Previously, I have always used wp_list_pages and a custom Walker class to provide hierarchical menus based on the page structure, but that's a topic for another post. This super-short snippet shows you how to add a login / logout link to one of your WordPress menus.\r\n\r\nWordPress contains some special functions for creating login and logout links: <kbd>wp_login_url</kbd> and <kbd>wp_logout_url</kbd>. They both take a string argument which is the URL you want them to redirect to after performing the login/logout action. In the example below I am adding the login / logout link to the beginning of the menu and redirecting to the home page (index.php) in both cases.\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n// functions.php\r\nfunction add_login_logout_link($items, $args)\r\n{\r\n  if(is_user_logged_in())\r\n  {\r\n    $newitems = '<li><a title=\"Logout\" href=\"'. wp_logout_url('index.php') .'\">Logout</a></li>';\r\n    $newitems .= $items;\r\n  }\r\n  else\r\n  {\r\n    $newitems = '<li><a title=\"Login\" href=\"'. wp_login_url('index.php') .'\">Login</a></li>';\r\n    $newitems .= $items;\r\n  }\r\n  return $newitems;\r\n}\r\nadd_filter('wp_nav_menu_items', 'add_login_logout_link', 10, 2);\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nIf the current user is logged in, they will see a logout link and vice versa. To use this snippet, copy and paste the code into your theme's functions.php file. You can easily change it to redirect to the dashboard after login, or have the login / logout link at the end of the menu like this:\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n// functions.php\r\nfunction add_login_logout_link($items, $args)\r\n{\r\n  if(is_user_logged_in())\r\n  {\r\n    $newitems = $items;\r\n    $newitems .= '<li><a title=\"Logout\" href=\"'. wp_logout_url('index.php') .'\">Logout</a></li>';\r\n  }\r\n  else\r\n  {\r\n    $newitems = $items;\r\n    $newitems .= '<li><a title=\"Login\" href=\"'. wp_login_url('wp-admin/index.php') .'\">Login</a></li>';\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return $newitems;\r\n}\r\nadd_filter('wp_nav_menu_items', 'add_login_logout_link', 10, 2);\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nYou can also place the login / logout link elsewhere in the menu structure. However, you need to split the menu items apart, locate the right position, insert your menu item and then stick the menu items back together again to return.

Previously, I have always used wp<em>list</em>pages and a custom Walker class to provide hierarchical menus based on the page structure, but that's a topic for another post. This super-short snippet shows you how to add a login / logout link to one of your WordPress menus.</p>\n\n<p>WordPress contains some special functions for creating login and logout links: <kbd>wp<em>login</em>url</kbd> and <kbd>wp<em>logout</em>url</kbd>. They both take a string argument which is the URL you want them to redirect to after performing the login/logout action. In the example below I am adding the login / logout link to the beginning of the menu and redirecting to the home page (index.php) in both cases.</p>\n\n<p>[cc lang=\"php\"]\n// functions.php\nfunction add<em>login</em>logout<em>link($items, $args) <br />\n{\n  if(is</em>user<em>logged</em>in())\n  {\n    $newitems = '<li><a title=\"Logout\" href=\"'. wp_logout_url('index.php') .'\">Logout</a></li>';\n    $newitems .= $items;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    $newitems = '<li><a title=\"Login\" href=\"'. wp_login_url('index.php') .'\">Login</a></li>';\n    $newitems .= $items;\n  }\n  return $newitems;\n}\nadd<em>filter('wp</em>nav<em>menu</em>items', 'add<em>login</em>logout_link', 10, 2); <br />\n[/cc]</p>\n\n<p>If the current user is logged in, they will see a logout link and vice versa. To use this snippet, copy and paste the code into your theme's functions.php file. You can easily change it to redirect to the dashboard after login, or have the login / logout link at the end of the menu like this:</p>\n\n<p>[cc lang=\"php\"]\n// functions.php\nfunction add<em>login</em>logout<em>link($items, $args) <br />\n{\n  if(is</em>user<em>logged</em>in())\n  {\n    $newitems = $items;\n    $newitems .= '<li><a title=\"Logout\" href=\"'. wp_logout_url('index.php') .'\">Logout</a></li>';\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    $newitems = $items;\n    $newitems .= '<li><a title=\"Login\" href=\"'. wp_login_url('wp-admin/index.php') .'\">Login</a></li>';\n  }</p>\n\n<p>return $newitems;\n}\nadd<em>filter('wp</em>nav<em>menu</em>items', 'add<em>login</em>logout_link', 10, 2); <br />\n[/cc]</p>\n\n<p>You can also place the login / logout link elsewhere in the menu structure. However, you need to split the menu items apart, locate the right position, insert your menu item and then stick the menu items back together again to return. An example of putting the link second is shown below:</p>\n\n<p>[cc lang=\"php\"]\n// functions.php\nfunction add<em>login</em>logout_link($items, $args) <br />\n{\n  $newposition = 2;</p>\n\n<p>// split the menu items into an array using the ending <li> tag\n  $items = explode('</li>',$items);</p>\n\n<p>// setup our new link (without the end li tag)\n  if(is<em>user</em>logged<em>in())\n  {\n    $newlink = '<li>' . $args->before . '<a title=\"Logout\" href=\"'. wp_logout_url('index.php') .'\">' . $args->link</em>before . 'Logout' . $args->link<em>after . '</a>' . $args->after; // no </li> needed this is added later\n  }\n  else\n  {\n  $newlink = '<li>' . $args->before . '<a title=\"Login\" href=\"'. wp_login_url('index.php') .'\">' . $args->link</em>before . 'Login' . $args->link_after . '</a>' . $args->after; // no </li> needed this is added later\n  }</p>\n\n<p>$newitems = array();</p>\n\n<p>// loop through the menu items, and add the new link at the right position\n  foreach($items as $index => $item)\n  {\n    // array indexes are always one less than the position (1st item is index 0)\n    if($index == $newposition-1)\n    {\n      $newitems[] = $newlink;\n    }\n    $newitems[] = $item;\n  }</p>\n\n<p>// finally put all the menu items back together into a string using the ending <li> tag and return\n  $newitems = implode('</li>',$newitems);</p>\n\n<p>return $newitems;\n}\nadd<em>filter('wp</em>nav<em>menu</em>items', 'add<em>login</em>logout_link', 10, 2); <br />\n[/cc]</p>\n\n<p>Note that in the above example, I have also used the <kbd>before</kbd>, <kbd>after</kbd>, <kbd>before<em>link</kbd> and <kbd>after</em>link</kbd> args values so that the additional link has the same display properties as the generated ones.

Recently I got a comment on that article asking if the admin menu could be altered for different users in a similar way. \r\n\r\nHere's the question:\r\n<blockquote>Can I lose the “add new” under Pages drop down for editors? I don’t want them to have the ability to create new pages.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI've played with the Wordpress admin menu a bit before now. There are two global variables which allow you to add (although there are <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus\" title=\"WP Codex: Adding Administration Menus\">much better ways</a> to do this) and more importantly remove items from the WordPress menu. These variables are <kbd>$menu</kbd> for top-level menu groups like \"Posts\", \"Media\" and <kbd>$submenu</kbd> for managing the sub-level items like \"Add New\" or \"Library\". \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wordpress_pages_menu2.png\" alt=\"WordPress Pages Menus\" title=\"wordpress_pages_menu2\" width=\"154\" height=\"201\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1559\" />In this case, we only want to remove the \"Add New\" sub-menu item from the pages menu, so we only need to use <kbd>$submenu</kbd>. If you use <kbd>var_dump</kbd> or <kbd>print_r</kbd> to display the contents of <kbd>$submenu</kbd> you'll see the part of the array for the \"Pages\" menu looks like the snippet below. It contains two entries: one for the \"Pages\" listing which allows you to edit pages, and one for the \"Add New\" link that we want to remove. Also note: for each sub-menu item there are three pieces of information: The text to show, the capability the user must have to see this link, and the relative URL for the menu item.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"small\"><strong>*Please note:</strong> all of the following will also work for posts. You will need to substitute the word \"page(s)\" for \"post(s)\" and follow the additional instructions. For other parts of the WordPress admin you'll need to find the right URLs, sub menu items and capabilities. All code should be placed in your theme's functions.php file. Full code example is here:  <a href='http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/functions.zip' onClick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/downloads/remove_add_new_link001']);\">functions.php [ZIP File]</a></p>\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\" line_numbers=\"false\" theme=\"default\"]\r\n// $submenu array...\r\n 'edit.php?post_type=page' => \r\n    array\r\n      5 => \r\n        array\r\n          0 => string 'Pages' (length=5)\r\n          1 => string 'edit_pages' (length=10)\r\n          2 => string 'edit.php?post_type=page' (length=23)\r\n      10 => \r\n        array\r\n          0 => string 'Add New' (length=7)\r\n          1 => string 'publish_pages' (length=13)\r\n          2 => string 'post-new.php?post_type=page' (length=27)\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nWith all this in mind, the simplest way to remove the \"Add New\" link from the pages menu, is to unset this part of the array before the menu is drawn. We can create a function to do this in the functions.php file, first declaring the <kbd>$submenu</kbd> global variable and then unsetting the bit that we don't want. Finally we need to add our function to the <kbd>admin_menu</kbd> action hook so that it is called at the right time.\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n// functions.php\r\nfunction modify_menu()\r\n{\r\n  global $submenu;\r\n  unset($submenu['edit.php?post_type=page'][10]);\r\n\r\n  // for posts it should be: \r\n  // unset($submenu['edit.php'][10]);\r\n}\r\n// call the function to modify the menu when the admin menu is drawn\r\nadd_action('admin_menu','modify_menu');\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nAt first glance we've now achieved what we set out to do - the \"Add New\" link is removed from the menu, however this doesn't really solve the underlying problem. The url for adding a new page is <kbd>post-new.php?post_type=page</kbd> and because we haven't changed the permissions of an editor they can still access the page. Furthermore, there is also an \"Add New\" link at the top of \"Pages\" list page - so they can also still find the page easily.\r\n\r\nSo what we really need to do, is change the capabilities of the \"editor\" role. In WordPress each role has a set of \"capabilities\" or permissions - things they are allowed to do. The capability that allows someone with the \"editor\" role to access the Add New Page screen is \"edit_page\", however if we remove this capability we will lose the whole \"Pages\" menu and also stop them being able to edit pages. \r\n\r\nThere is no way to use capabilities to restrict access to the Add New Page screen without also restricting access to the Pages list & Edit page screen. However, we can stop people from being able to publish pages using the \"publish_pages\" capability - this means they can create pages but they won't appear on the website. Although this isn't a perfect solution, it seems like a good start.\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n// functions.php\r\nfunction modify_capabilities()\r\n{\r\n  // get the role you want to change: editor, author, contributor, subscriber\r\n  $editor_role = get_role('editor');\r\n  $editor_role->remove_cap('publish_pages');\r\n  \r\n  // for posts it should be:\r\n  // $editor_role->remove_cap('publish_posts');\r\n  \r\n  // to add capabilities use add_cap()\r\n}\r\n\r\nadd_action('admin_init','modify_capabilities');\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nThe above snippet shows a function which gets the \"editor\" role and removes the \"publish_pages\" capability. This is hooked into \"admin_init\" so that it is run on each admin page. Now when editors go to the Add New Page screen they will only be able to \"Submit for review\" not publish the page. So now we know how to both actually stop users from creating pages AND remove the sub-menu item. \r\n\r\nNow that we're working with capabilities, we can change our <kbd>modify_menu</kbd> function to do the same. Instead of completely unsetting the menu item, we can set the capability so that it only works if the user has the capability \"publish_pages\". This is just a slightly nicer way to hide the menu item - you could grant one specific editor user the \"publish_pages\" capability and they would still be able to access the menu item.\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\" highlight=\"5\"]\r\n// functions.php\r\nfunction modify_menu()\r\n{\r\n  global $submenu;\r\n  $submenu['edit.php?post_type=page'][10][1] = 'publish_pages';\r\n\r\n  // for posts it should be:\r\n  // $submenu['edit.php'][10][1] = 'publish_posts';\r\n}\r\nadd_action('admin_menu','modify_menu');\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nNext let's get rid of that pesky \"Add New\" button on the Pages list screen. There doesn't seem to be a hook we can use to do this, so instead I've used good ol' fashioned CSS. We check if we are on the \"edit-page\" screen using the <kbd>$current_screen</kbd> global variable and if the user has the \"publish_pages\" capability using the <kbd>current_user_can</kbd> method. Then we spit out some CSS to hide the button and hook this into admin_head to the CSS is output in a sensible place.\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n// functions.php\r\nfunction hide_buttons()\r\n{\r\n  global $current_screen;\r\n  \r\n  if($current_screen->id == 'edit-page' && !current_user_can('publish_pages'))\r\n  {\r\n    echo '<style>.add-new-h2{display: none;}</style>';  \r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // for posts the if statement would be:\r\n  // if($current_screen->id == 'edit-post' && !current_user_can('publish_posts'))\r\n}\r\nadd_action('admin_head','hide_buttons');\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nNow we have editors which cannot see the \"Add New\" link in the Pages menu, or the button on the Pages screen, so there's no easy way for them to get there. Even if they are clever enough to figure out the URL they won't actually be able to publish their pages. However if we want to go the whole hog, we can add a bit more code to redirect them from the Add New Page screen and show them an error message.\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n// functions.php\r\nfunction permissions_admin_redirect() {\r\n  $result = stripos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'post-new.php?post_type=page');\r\n  \r\n  // for posts result should be:  \r\n  // $result = stripos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'post-new.php');\r\n  \r\n  if ($result!==false && !current_user_can('publish_pages')) {\r\n    wp_redirect(get_option('siteurl') . '/wp-admin/index.php?permissions_error=true');\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // for posts the if statement should be:\r\n  // if ($result!==false && !current_user_can('publish_posts')) {\r\n}\r\n\r\nadd_action('admin_menu','permissions_admin_redirect');\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nThe above is an additional function to test the current request URI. If it matches the Add New Page screen AND the user doesn't have the \"publish_page\" capability we redirect them to the admin dashboard. The dashboard URL is <kbd>/wp-admin/index.php</kbd>, but I've added <kbd>permissions_error=true</kbd> so that WordPress will know to show an error message.\r\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\r\n// functions.php\r\nfunction permissions_admin_notice()\r\n{\r\n  // use the class \"error\" for red notices, and \"update\" for yellow notices\r\n  echo \"<div id='permissions-warning' class='error fade'><p><strong>\".__('You do not have permission to access that page.').\"</strong></p></div>\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction permissions_show_notice()\r\n{\r\n  if($_GET['permissions_error'])\r\n  {\r\n    add_action('admin_notices', 'permissions_admin_notice');  \r\n  }\r\n}\r\nadd_action('admin_init','permissions_show_notice');\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nFinally, two more functions and one more action hook. The first to draw an error message / warning to the user, and the second which checks the \"permissions_error\" parameter and shows the error message if it is set. Now there is absolutely no way for an editor to get to the Add New Page screen, instead they will be redirected to the dashboard and shown an error.\r\n\r\nSo this all turned out to be ever-so-slightly more complicated that I expected because there is no way to distinguish between the permission to edit and the permission to add a page or post. However, like most things in WordPress with a bit of graft it's usually possible! I hope this has been useful, if you got lost or  something doesn't make sense or you know of a better way to do this <em>please</em> let me know via the comments.\r\n\r\n<strong>Code Example:</strong> All code should go into your theme's functions.php file.

We check if we are on the \"edit-page\" screen using the <kbd>$current<em>screen</kbd> global variable and if the user has the \"publish</em>pages\" capability using the <kbd>current<em>user</em>can</kbd> method. Then we spit out some CSS to hide the button and hook this into admin_head to the CSS is output in a sensible place.</p>\n\n<p>[cc lang=\"php\"]\n// functions.php\nfunction hide<em>buttons() <br />\n{\n  global $current</em>screen;</p>\n\n<p>if($current<em>screen->id == 'edit-page' &amp;&amp; !current</em>user<em>can('publish</em>pages'))\n  {\n    echo '<style>.add-new-h2{display: none;}</style>'; <br />\n  }</p>\n\n<p>// for posts the if statement would be:\n  // if($current<em>screen->id == 'edit-post' &amp;&amp; !current</em>user<em>can('publish</em>posts'))\n}\nadd<em>action('admin</em>head','hide_buttons'); <br />\n[/cc]</p>\n\n<p>Now we have editors which cannot see the \"Add New\" link in the Pages menu, or the button on the Pages screen, so there's no easy way for them to get there. Even if they are clever enough to figure out the URL they won't actually be able to publish their pages. However if we want to go the whole hog, we can add a bit more code to redirect them from the Add New Page screen and show them an error message.</p>\n\n<p>[cc lang=\"php\"]\n// functions.php\nfunction permissions<em>admin</em>redirect() { <br />\n  $result = stripos($<em>SERVER['REQUEST</em>URI'], 'post-new.php?post_type=page');</p>\n\n<p>// for posts result should be: <br />\n  // $result = stripos($<em>SERVER['REQUEST</em>URI'], 'post-new.php');</p>\n\n<p>if ($result!==false &amp;&amp; !current<em>user</em>can('publish<em>pages')) {\n    wp</em>redirect(get<em>option('siteurl') . '/wp-admin/index.php?permissions</em>error=true');\n  }</p>\n\n<p>// for posts the if statement should be:\n  // if ($result!==false &amp;&amp; !current<em>user</em>can('publish_posts')) {\n}</p>\n\n<p>add<em>action('admin</em>menu','permissions<em>admin</em>redirect'); <br />\n[/cc]</p>\n\n<p>The above is an additional function to test the current request URI. If it matches the Add New Page screen AND the user doesn't have the \"publish<em>page\" capability we redirect them to the admin dashboard. The dashboard URL is <kbd>/wp-admin/index.php</kbd>, but I've added <kbd>permissions</em>error=true</kbd> so that WordPress will know to show an error message. <br />\n[cc lang=\"php\"]\n// functions.php\nfunction permissions<em>admin</em>notice() <br />\n{\n  // use the class \"error\" for red notices, and \"update\" for yellow notices\n  echo \"<div id='permissions-warning' class='error fade'><p><strong>\".__('You do not have permission to access that page.').\"</strong></p></div>\";\n}</p>\n\n<p>function permissions<em>show</em>notice() <br />\n{\n  if($<em>GET['permissions</em>error'])\n  {\n    add<em>action('admin</em>notices', 'permissions<em>admin</em>notice'); <br />\n  }\n}\nadd<em>action('admin</em>init','permissions<em>show</em>notice'); <br />\n[/cc]</p>\n\n<p>Finally, two more functions and one more action hook. The first to draw an error message / warning to the user, and the second which checks the \"permissions_error\" parameter and shows the error message if it is set. Now there is absolutely no way for an editor to get to the Add New Page screen, instead they will be redirected to the dashboard and shown an error.</p>\n\n<p>So this all turned out to be ever-so-slightly more complicated that I expected because there is no way to distinguish between the permission to edit and the permission to add a page or post. However, like most things in WordPress with a bit of graft it's usually possible! I hope this has been useful, if you got lost or  something doesn't make sense or you know of a better way to do this <em>please</em> let me know via the comments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Code Example:</strong> All code should go into your theme's functions.php file.

You've now got all the working plugins enabled and the site is almost back to normal... so backup before upgrading your plugins!</li>\r\n  <li>Upgrade each plugin one-by-one (and reactivate if necessary), again testing after each upgrade.</li>\r\n  <li>You may have to find new plugins to replace old ones which are no longer maintained, but with luck your site should now be back to normal.</li>\r\n</ul> ","html":"<p><img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wordpress-logo-notext-rgb-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"WordPress logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1389\" />Earlier this week I received an email requesting some help with a WordPress install that had been hacked.

Not a bug, not a snag, not a hitch - easy peasy!</p>\n\n<h2>My Top Tips</h2>\n\n<p>Some additional things I recommend doing are:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n  <li>Be absolutely sure to deactivate all your plugins before deleting files and starting the upgrade process</li>\n  <li>Once the upgrade process has run, check your website thoroughly before reactivating or upgrading any plugins</li>\n  <li>If all is OK, take another backup of the database and files at this point</li>\n  <li>After backing up, reactivate each plugin one-by-one testing the site thoroughly after each reactivation to ensure no bugs are caused and that the plugin provides the expected functionality.</li>\n  <li>Take note of any plugins which malfunction, see if there is an available upgrade (don't run it yet) and deactivate the plugin until you have tested them all</li>\n  <li>Backup again! You've now got all the working plugins enabled and the site is almost back to normal... so backup before upgrading your plugins!</li>\n  <li>Upgrade each plugin one-by-one (and reactivate if necessary), again testing after each upgrade.</li>\n  <li>You may have to find new plugins to replace old ones which are no longer maintained, but with luck your site should now be back to normal.</li>\n</ul> ","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1382037746419,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1382037746419,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1278077258000,"published_by":1},{"id":67,"uuid":"43b17596-ae9b-45d9-a892-f5490d72adbc","title":"Spotlight: Symfony Forms - Saving Extra Form Fields","slug":"temp-slug-60","markdown":"","html":"","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1382037746420,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1382037746420,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1277904867000,"published_by":1},{"id":68,"uuid":"4ff0d93f-f5da-48d0-a169-03ff471c8c71","title":"Snippets","slug":"temp-slug-61","markdown":"\r\n    $c->add(NewsPeer::CREATED_AT, 'MONTH('.NewsPeer::CREATED_AT.')='. $month, Criteria::CUSTOM);\r\n    $c->addAnd(NewsPeer::CREATED_AT, 'YEAR('.NewsPeer::CREATED_AT.')='. $year, Criteria::CUSTOM);\r\n\r\nadditional filters","html":"<pre><code>$c-&gt;add(NewsPeer::CREATED_AT, 'MONTH('.NewsPeer::CREATED_AT.')='. $month, Criteria::CUSTOM);\n$c-&gt;addAnd(NewsPeer::CREATED_AT, 'YEAR('.NewsPeer::CREATED_AT.')='. $year, Criteria::CUSTOM);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>additional filters</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1382037746420,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1382037746420,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1277904733000,"published_by":1},{"id":69,"uuid":"d84df015-852c-4cfe-9869-4d52702bba15","title":"Snippet: Wordpress Admin - Tidy Dashboard Widgets By Role","slug":"snippet-wordpress-admin-tidy-dashboard-widgets-by-role","markdown":"Recently I worked on a Wordpress site where I wanted to be able to customise the dashboard for different user roles. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities\">Wordpress has the default roles</a> of administrators, editors, authors, contributors and subscribers.

The show seems to be gathering strength with each new episode and I thought it about time I shared my thoughts. If you haven't heard the podcast yet, I recommend checking us out either at the <a title=\"ExplictWeb Podcast \" href=\"http://explicitweb.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">ExplicitWeb site</a> or our page on <a title=\"Explicit Web on iTunes\" href=\"http://bit.ly/cun27g\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a>.\r\n\r\nExplicitWeb came from a series of conversations between <a title=\"John O'Nolan on ExplicitWeb\" href=\"http://john.onolan.org/the-explicitweb-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">John O'Nolan</a>, <a title=\"Rob Hawkes on ExplicitWeb\" href=\"http://rawkes.com/blog/2010/03/10/explicitweb-a-podcast-from-the-front-lines-of-web-development\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Hawkes</a> and I regarding the state of web industry podcasts. We felt that the existing podcasts were often overly long and self-indulgent, many focus on one subject per show making them hit-and-miss, and most are done by professional podcasters, or people who have become professional podcasters meaning they no longer practise web design and development on a daily basis.

Using \"Transactional Analysis\" I'm going to help you figure out what's going wrong and perhaps set things straight with those problematic client relationships.\r\n\r\nThe phrase <em>\"problematic client relationship\"</em> was chosen very carefully. I don't doubt for a second that your nightmare client is being difficult, but I also believe that it's far harder to change their behaviour than it is to change your own. More importantly, the key is to realise that the problem <em>between</em> you and your client lies in the relationship <em>between</em> you and your client. By changing the relationship, you can resolve your differences without ever having to directly confront them.\r\n\r\n<h3>Transactional Analysis</h3>\r\nBefore you close the page because of the scary psycho-babble term, <strong>WAIT</strong>! It's just a posh name for a really clever, yet simple premise that WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER. Please bear with me whilst I attempt to explain it in as few words as possible then I'll cut to the fun stuff with examples.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ta.png\" alt=\"Transactional Analysis Diagram\" title=\"Transactional Analysis Diagram\" width=\"300\" height=\"280\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1245\" />Transactional Analysis (<abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr>) theory says that when ever two people communicate, they do so whilst acting in one of three roles: parent, adult or child. These aren't actual parents, adults and children, they are concepts: e.g. a parent assumes authority & takes a lot of responsibility, a child accepts the authority of others and takes very little responsibility and an adult is the \"grown-up\" happy middle ground. A parent and child can successfully communicate (although it's not always appropriate) and so can two adults, but any other pairing would likely result in communication breakdown.\r\n\r\nMost communication should be done adult to adult. When one person starts out or inadvertantly slips from adult into the parent or child role, it causes communication to become strained, or worse can force the other person to reactively slip into the opposite role. This can be a source of major frustration and difficulty for either party.\r\n\r\n<abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr>'s core principle is that whenever there is a breakdown in communication, it can always be attributed to one or the other parties acting in an inappropriate role for the situation. Applying this to the service provider - client relationship, communication should always be adult to adult. Each party on equal terms, consulting and working together to achieve a common goal. With that in mind, let's analyse some typical scenarios.\r\n\r\n<h3>Classic Clients</h3>\r\n\r\nHave a read through these classic client scenarios and see if you can figure out what the cause of the breakdown in communication is according to <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr>. I explain my thoughts below, but they're all open to interpretation!\r\n\r\n<strong>Classic Client 1:</strong> You get an email from a client, containing a vague brief for a 5 page website. After asking for some more detail, they reply they aren't too sure, can they pay you to sort it all out? After all you're the professional! You take on the job, hire a copywriter & are really enjoying having the freedom to express yourself on a project. 2 weeks before launch , you receive and email from the client saying: <em>\"We're really sorry, but we've changed our minds, we don't like the website any more. It just really isn't what we had in mind.\"</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Classic Client 2:</strong> You get an email from a client, containing a detailed brief for a new website. You agree to work with them and set about designing the site. You show the client what is your best design yet, you're really happy with it and they are too, only they want to make a few minor amends. You concede, after all it's only a few tiny changes. You start the build stage, and receive a couple of requests for further \"5 minute amends\", again they're only small so you oblige. A few weeks before launch the client sees a near-complete working example and provides some feedback: <em>\"In my head the latest news block was going to scroll, oh and can we change the headers to be large, bold, red, and comic sans?\"</em>.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"halfwidth alignright\"><em>\"...whenever there is a breakdown in communication, it can always be attributed to one or the other parties acting in an inappropriate role for the situation.\"</em>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>My thoughts</h4>\r\n\r\n<strong>Classic Client 1:</strong> This client is clearly not willing to take on any responsibility or authority for their project i.e. acting in the \"child\" role. I'd guess that their initial decision to be uninvolved made them feel less able to communicate their own thoughts later on, only communicating when it became obvious that they were going to have to pay for something that didn't meet their expectations. The service provider was almost tricked into assuming responsibility, I mean who wouldn't jump at the opportunity to have free reign over a project?\r\n\r\n<strong>Classic Client 2:</strong> Slowly over the course of the project, this client has grown accustomed to getting their own way, to being the \"parent\" or \"authority\". Now they expect changes they request to be carried out and the service provider is feeling unable to communicate their objections. This gradual change of roles is really hard to detect & is a great example of the frustation that is felt by the \"child\".\r\n\r\n<h3>In Conclusion...</h3>\r\nSo what have we learnt from this exercise? Using <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr> we have an excellent tool for analysing our relationships and determining the root cause of a communication problem. However determining the cause is only half the story - we can also infer from <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr> how to go about resolving communication breakdowns.\r\n\r\nIf the problem is caused by slipping out of the appropriate \"adult\" role then clearly the resolution is to retake the correct role. In the same way that one party adopting the parent role can force the other to react in the child role, it should be possible to maintain the adult role and coerce your client to respond in kind. This principle should guide your actions but does require skill and good judgement.\r\n\r\nIt is far harder to apply the principles of <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr> \"after the fact\" - what it is better at, is prevention. <strong>Educating</strong> your clients throughout your relationship as to what should be expected from each of you is a great way to help ensure your client holds up their end of the bargain. I tend to find that life is full of <strong>little slips</strong>, where one or other person in a communication slips into the wrong role temporarily. <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr> allows us to identify and recover from these slips much more quickly, averting disaster. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"halfwidth alignright\"><em><strong>Client:</strong> “You need to learn how to run a business.

This topic is possibly easier to digest in audio form, so I highly recommend you have a listen!</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/dreamstimefree_351344-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Conference Room\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1209\" /><strong>Nightmare clients:</strong> We've all had them. <br />\nThey come in all shapes &amp; sizes: needy ones, demanding ones, ones that know too much, ones that know too little, ones that don't call, ones that don't pay, and all making our lives a more difficult that we'd like them to be. Using \"Transactional Analysis\" I'm going to help you figure out what's going wrong and perhaps set things straight with those problematic client relationships.</p>\n\n<p>The phrase <em>\"problematic client relationship\"</em> was chosen very carefully. I don't doubt for a second that your nightmare client is being difficult, but I also believe that it's far harder to change their behaviour than it is to change your own. More importantly, the key is to realise that the problem <em>between</em> you and your client lies in the relationship <em>between</em> you and your client. By changing the relationship, you can resolve your differences without ever having to directly confront them.</p>\n\n<h3>Transactional Analysis</h3>  \n\n<p>Before you close the page because of the scary psycho-babble term, <strong>WAIT</strong>! It's just a posh name for a really clever, yet simple premise that WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER. Please bear with me whilst I attempt to explain it in as few words as possible then I'll cut to the fun stuff with examples.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ta.png\" alt=\"Transactional Analysis Diagram\" title=\"Transactional Analysis Diagram\" width=\"300\" height=\"280\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1245\" />Transactional Analysis (<abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr>) theory says that when ever two people communicate, they do so whilst acting in one of three roles: parent, adult or child. These aren't actual parents, adults and children, they are concepts: e.g. a parent assumes authority &amp; takes a lot of responsibility, a child accepts the authority of others and takes very little responsibility and an adult is the \"grown-up\" happy middle ground. A parent and child can successfully communicate (although it's not always appropriate) and so can two adults, but any other pairing would likely result in communication breakdown.</p>\n\n<p>Most communication should be done adult to adult. When one person starts out or inadvertantly slips from adult into the parent or child role, it causes communication to become strained, or worse can force the other person to reactively slip into the opposite role. This can be a source of major frustration and difficulty for either party.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr>'s core principle is that whenever there is a breakdown in communication, it can always be attributed to one or the other parties acting in an inappropriate role for the situation. Applying this to the service provider - client relationship, communication should always be adult to adult. Each party on equal terms, consulting and working together to achieve a common goal. With that in mind, let's analyse some typical scenarios.</p>\n\n<h3>Classic Clients</h3>\n\n<p>Have a read through these classic client scenarios and see if you can figure out what the cause of the breakdown in communication is according to <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr>. I explain my thoughts below, but they're all open to interpretation!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Classic Client 1:</strong> You get an email from a client, containing a vague brief for a 5 page website. After asking for some more detail, they reply they aren't too sure, can they pay you to sort it all out? After all you're the professional! You take on the job, hire a copywriter &amp; are really enjoying having the freedom to express yourself on a project. 2 weeks before launch , you receive and email from the client saying: <em>\"We're really sorry, but we've changed our minds, we don't like the website any more. It just really isn't what we had in mind.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Classic Client 2:</strong> You get an email from a client, containing a detailed brief for a new website. You agree to work with them and set about designing the site. You show the client what is your best design yet, you're really happy with it and they are too, only they want to make a few minor amends. You concede, after all it's only a few tiny changes. You start the build stage, and receive a couple of requests for further \"5 minute amends\", again they're only small so you oblige. A few weeks before launch the client sees a near-complete working example and provides some feedback: <em>\"In my head the latest news block was going to scroll, oh and can we change the headers to be large, bold, red, and comic sans?\"</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"halfwidth alignright\"><em>\"...whenever there is a breakdown in communication, it can always be attributed to one or the other parties acting in an inappropriate role for the situation.\"</em>  \n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>My thoughts</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Classic Client 1:</strong> This client is clearly not willing to take on any responsibility or authority for their project i.e. acting in the \"child\" role. I'd guess that their initial decision to be uninvolved made them feel less able to communicate their own thoughts later on, only communicating when it became obvious that they were going to have to pay for something that didn't meet their expectations. The service provider was almost tricked into assuming responsibility, I mean who wouldn't jump at the opportunity to have free reign over a project?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Classic Client 2:</strong> Slowly over the course of the project, this client has grown accustomed to getting their own way, to being the \"parent\" or \"authority\". Now they expect changes they request to be carried out and the service provider is feeling unable to communicate their objections. This gradual change of roles is really hard to detect &amp; is a great example of the frustation that is felt by the \"child\".</p>\n\n<h3>In Conclusion...</h3>  \n\n<p>So what have we learnt from this exercise? Using <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr> we have an excellent tool for analysing our relationships and determining the root cause of a communication problem. However determining the cause is only half the story - we can also infer from <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr> how to go about resolving communication breakdowns.</p>\n\n<p>If the problem is caused by slipping out of the appropriate \"adult\" role then clearly the resolution is to retake the correct role. In the same way that one party adopting the parent role can force the other to react in the child role, it should be possible to maintain the adult role and coerce your client to respond in kind. This principle should guide your actions but does require skill and good judgement.</p>\n\n<p>It is far harder to apply the principles of <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr> \"after the fact\" - what it is better at, is prevention. <strong>Educating</strong> your clients throughout your relationship as to what should be expected from each of you is a great way to help ensure your client holds up their end of the bargain. I tend to find that life is full of <strong>little slips</strong>, where one or other person in a communication slips into the wrong role temporarily. <abbr title=\"Transactional Analysis\">TA</abbr> allows us to identify and recover from these slips much more quickly, averting disaster. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"halfwidth alignright\"><em><strong>Client:</strong> “You need to learn how to run a business. You fucking kids don’t know anything, and just want to rip all us honest business people off.” </em><cite><a href=\"http://clientsfromhell.net/post/598616578/client-were-not-happy-with-the-website-design\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Clients from Hell\">Clients from Hell</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, there is just no accounting for some people (I recommend a visit to the <a href=\"http://clientsfromhell.net\" title=\"Clients from Hell\" target=\"_blank\">Clients from Hell blog</a>). Sometimes we have to execute disaster avoidance - if a new client approaches you acting as parent or child, and one or two carefully worded communications doesn't resolve the problem, then cut your losses or resolve yourself to a nightmare project. Some client relationships are best solved by not having them at all.</p>\n\n<h3>Relevant & Related Writings</h3>  \n\n<ul>  \n    <li><a href=\"http://john.onolan.org/avoiding-nightmare-clients/\" title=\"Avoiding nightmare clients - John O'Nolan\" target=\"_blank\">Avoiding nightmare clients</a> - John O'Nolan</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://boagworld.com/news/educating-clients-to-say-yes\" title=\"Educating Clients to say Yes\" target=\"_blank\">Educating Clients to say Yes</a> - Boag World</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/23/educating-your-client-on-web-development-successfully/\" title=\"Educating your client on web development successfully.\" target=\"_blank\">Educating your client on web development successfully.</a> - Smashing Magazine</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://sam.brown.tc/entry/416/the-importance-of-teaching-your-clients-and-being-the-boss\" title=\"The importance of teaching your clients and being the boss\" target=\"_blank\">The importance of teaching your clients and being the boss</a> - Sam Brown</li>\n</ul>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1382037746426,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1382037746426,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1275418824000,"published_by":1},{"id":74,"uuid":"319208d0-6e30-42a0-aa65-2b78d47f4bf4","title":"HTML Canvas: Going Ninja with .Net Magazine's Processing.js tutorial","slug":"html-canvas-going-ninja-with-net-magazines-processing-js-tutorial","markdown":"<a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/html-5-canvas-ninja-mini-game-demo\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1155\" title=\"HTML 5 Canvas: Ninja mini-game demo\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ninja-300x224.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a>Yesterday I finally got around to sitting down and playing with the Canvas and Processing.js tutorial in last month's issue of .Net Magazine (Issue 202, pages 82-85). I have been wanting to try my hand at HTML5 Canvas since Rob got me interested during the HTML5 special of the <a title=\"ExplicitWeb\" href=\"http://explicitweb.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">ExplicitWeb podcast</a> we recorded back in March (note the subtle plug) and this tutorial seemed like a good way of getting stuck in.\r\n<h3>Getting it working in Google Chrome (or not)</h3>\r\nGetting started, I fired up a text editor and did step one only to find that nothing appeared in Google Chrome but Firefox was working perfectly. I was certain Google Chrome supported canvas, <a title=\"Wikipedia: Canvas Element\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a> said so, this <a title=\"HTML5 browser readiness visualisation\" href=\"http://html5readiness.com/\" target=\"_blank\">awesome visualisation of HTML5 readiness</a> said so, hell even <a title=\"Processing JS homepage\" href=\"http://processingjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the Processing.js homepage</a> said so, so it wasn't even that Processing JS was the problem. After pouring over the code and a bit of Googling I stumbled across <a href=\"https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284/tickets/418-2d-sketches-which-use-xhr-fail-to-load-on-chromium \" target=\"_blank\">this ticket on the Processing JS website</a>, which basically points to a <a title=\"Google Chrome ajax bug\" href=\"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23429\" target=\"_blank\">bug in Google Chrome</a> as a the source of the problem, but only in certain versions.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that processing adds a <kbd>data-src</kbd> attribute to the Canvas element, which is then used to pull in the Processing JS code via ajax. Some bug in Google Chrome means the ajax call fails, and therefore nothing happens. The work around is to include all your processing code on the page inside script tags, and use the <kbd>processing.init.js</kbd> script to load it in:\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"html\"]\r\n...\r\n<head>\r\n<script src=\"processing.init.js\"></script> \r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<script type=\"application/processing\">\r\n  //processing code here...\r\n</script>\r\n<canvas>\r\n</canvas>\r\n...\r\n[/cc]\r\nYou can see an example of Processing JS done this way by viewing the full source of the <a href=\" http://processingjs.org/source/basic-example/processingjs_basic-example.html\">basic demo</a> on the Processing JS homepage. This works really well, except for the drawback of having all your Processing code inline on the page, which doesn't play too well with Wordpress. Therefore, the <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/html-5-canvas-ninja-mini-game-demo\" target=\"_blank\">game demo page</a> doesn't work in all versions of Google Chome (particularly not in the latest standard release but it does work in the latest beta release).\r\n<h3>Playing with some crazy eyes</h3>\r\nThe problem with coding tutorials, I always find, is that you end up just copying and pasting without truly understanding the nuances of what you are doing: What does that function do? Which argument is which and what are they for? Why' is the code in that order? This was especially true with this Processing tutorial with it's smattering of trigonometry &amp; use of functions like <kbd>ellipse</kbd> or <kbd>arc</kbd> with no description of the arguments.The only cure is to get stuck in.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I decided I wanted to do, was change the way the eyes move. It seems wrong to me that they remain equi-distant even when they are to the far left and right, I wanted to make them get closer together. The ninja's head, body and eyes are all fixed on the y axis - they only move left-to-right so I figured I could do this quite easily.\r\n\r\nThe arc function used to draw the eyes takes 6 arguments: x position, y position, width, height, start angle, stop angle. Therefore to change the distance between the eyes I needed to change the first argument so that the way the x position of the left and right eye relate to each other is different based on the mouse's position.\r\n\r\nI changed this:\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"javascript\"]\r\narc(-10-sin(trackAngle)*7,8,6,6,TWO_PI,0); // Draw left eye\r\narc(10-sin(trackAngle)*7,8,6,6,TWO_PI,0); // Draw right eye\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nTo this:\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"javascript\"]\r\narc(-10-sin(trackAngle)*(10-2*trackAngle),8,6,6,TWO_PI,0); // Draw left eye\r\narc(10-sin(trackAngle)*(10+2*trackAngle),8,6,6,TWO_PI,0); // Draw right eye\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nThe first part of the x position <kbd>-10-sin(trackAngle)</kbd> placed the eyes and makes them move with the head. The modifying value (originally 7) is what makes the eyes move further than the head - so they move further left or right relative to the heads position. <kbd>trackAngle</kbd> is measured in radians and therefore ranges between -1.2 and 1.2. I multiplied this by 2 to make it more significant, and used it to change what the modifying value is. Now the eyes not only move further relative to the head, but also relative to each other.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a weird effect - but I'm pretty pleased with it :)\r\n<h3>Making a mini game</h3>\r\nOnce I was happy with the eyes, and had gotten a good grasp of the math going on, I decided to make it even more interactive, and turn it into a little game. The little ninja's arms flying all over the place seemed to want something to hit, so I introduced a dot which appears randomly somewhere on the screen, stays put for just over a second, and then disappears and reappears somewhere else. The dot disappears and reappears faster and faster as time goes on.\r\n\r\nI added some code to the <kbd>mouseMoved</kbd> function to test if the mouse's new position matches the dot's position, and if so adds one to the score and forces the dot to move again. Finally I added a box and some text to display the score in the top right corner, which was interesting as the tutorial doesn't cover text:\r\n\r\n[cc lang=\"javascript\"]\r\n\r\nvoid drawScore()\r\n{\r\nPFont fontA = loadFont(\"Arial\");\r\ntextFont(fontA, 36);\r\nninjaStyle(function(){ rect(width-50, height-(height-20), 30, 16) });\r\nfill(#CD3700);\r\ntext(score, width-57, height-(height-41));\r\n}\r\n\r\n[/cc]\r\n\r\nSo there we have it, a <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/html-5-canvas-ninja-mini-game-demo\" target=\"_blank\">mini ninja fighting game</a>. You'll need to visit the demo page to play the game as this blog isn't (quite) yet running HTML5. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't really do any of the things I'd expect a real game to (yet), like have a start / pause button, a sound track, or a leader board. It could probably do with a samurai sword whizzing around and splitting the dots in half... obviously with plenty of blood and gore. It does however get progressively more difficult, the most I've scored is 92. The test is to see if anyone can show me a screenshot with a score of 100 and a broken scorebox ;)\r\n\r\n<p class=\"small\"><strong>Please note:</strong> the original code, imagery & styles were all published in .Net Magazine and were created by Alistair MacDonald of <a href=\"http://www.bocoup.com\">Bocoup.com</a></p></body>","html":"<p><a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/html-5-canvas-ninja-mini-game-demo\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1155\" title=\"HTML 5 Canvas: Ninja mini-game demo\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ninja-300x224.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a>Yesterday I finally got around to sitting down and playing with the Canvas and Processing.js tutorial in last month's issue of .Net Magazine (Issue 202, pages 82-85).

This article will cover a lot of ground, mostly in adding lots of navigation options with javascript. Part 3 was intended to be the final part of this series, however there is now likely to be at least a fourth part.\r\n<h2>Setting Up - Referencing YUI</h2>\r\n\r\nFirst things first, as in Part 2 we need to include the YUI Javascript files, our own carousel.js and our own carousel.css but <strong>NOT</strong> the YUI carousel.css. If you include the YUI CSS file you will find that your carousel does not look or work how you expect!\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"html4strict\">\r\n<head>\r\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/carousel.css\" />\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <!-- Content here -->\r\n\r\n  <script src=\"http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.7.0/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js&amp;2.7.0/build/element/element-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/animation/animation-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/carousel/carousel-min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n  <script src=\"js/carousel.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<h2>Setting Up - The Base HTML &amp; CSS</h2>\r\nThe HTML we need this time is slightly more lengthly than in the previous articles as we need to mark up an additional list to use as our navigation, and I have also added buttons for previous, next and play-pause. All of my examples use static HTML, but of course you can build the carousel and it's navigation dynamically if need be. I have successfully integrated the YUI carousel as a dynamic component in both Symfony and Wordpress projects.\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"html4strict\">\r\n<div id=\"carousel-3\" class=\"carousel\">\r\n  <ol id=\"carousel-3-nav\" class=\"carousel-nav\">\r\n    <li class=\"first active\"><a href=\"#\">Baby Dolphin</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Feeding Birds</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Tiger</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Zebra</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Sea Lion</a></li>\r\n    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"#\">Discovery Cove</a></li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <div id=\"carousel-3-container\" class=\"carousel-container\">\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-nav-bar\">\r\n      <span class=\"carousel-prev\"></span>\r\n      <span class=\"carousel-next\"></span>\r\n      <span class=\"carousel-play-pause carousel-pause\"></span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <ol class=\"carousel-content\">\r\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2181/3529457733_50200b99ab_m.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Dolphin\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\r\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3543/3514480796_2243d70d6b_m.jpg\" alt=\"Birds\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\r\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3306/3503294318_c34fab9d17_m.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\r\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3583/3530272148_4902b92aee_m.jpg\" alt=\"Zebra\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\r\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/3502485517_5d7a6fd6fa_m.jpg\" alt=\"Sealion2\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\r\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3603/3513671837_9eef80c4ac_m.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Cove\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\r\n     </ol>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<h2>Setting Up - Javascript</h2>\r\nThe Javascript used in this article is extensive. If you get lost please take a look at the complete code as provided on GitHub. If you're still stuck, send me an email via <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/connect#contact\">my contact form</a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 1 - Basic Carousel Setup</h3>\r\n\r\nThe Carousel setup comes in two parts, and is different again to the previous articles (because variety is the spice of life, and because I'm still relatively new to Javascript and enjoy exploring different ways of doing things). In order to get the Carousel using custom navigation we will have to write several methods, so we will extend the YUI Carousel widget into our own widget which has these additional methods.\r\n\r\nTo extend the carousel we need to first create a carousel object and then call extend with all of our additional properties and methods.

This article will cover a lot of ground, mostly in adding lots of navigation options with javascript. Part 3 was intended to be the final part of this series, however there is now likely to be at least a fourth part.  </p>\n\n<h2>Setting Up - Referencing YUI</h2>\n\n<p>First things first, as in Part 2 we need to include the YUI Javascript files, our own carousel.js and our own carousel.css but <strong>NOT</strong> the YUI carousel.css. If you include the YUI CSS file you will find that your carousel does not look or work how you expect!</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"html4strict\"> <br />\n<head> <br />\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/carousel.css\" />\n</head> <br />\n<body> <br />\n    <!-- Content here --></p>\n\n<p><script src=\"http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.7.0/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js&amp;2.7.0/build/element/element-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/animation/animation-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/carousel/carousel-min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n  <script src=\"js/carousel.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</body> <br />\n</code></p>\n\n<h2>Setting Up - The Base HTML &amp; CSS</h2>  \n\n<p>The HTML we need this time is slightly more lengthly than in the previous articles as we need to mark up an additional list to use as our navigation, and I have also added buttons for previous, next and play-pause. All of my examples use static HTML, but of course you can build the carousel and it's navigation dynamically if need be. I have successfully integrated the YUI carousel as a dynamic component in both Symfony and Wordpress projects.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"html4strict\">  </p>\n\n<div id=\"carousel-3\" class=\"carousel\">  \n  <ol id=\"carousel-3-nav\" class=\"carousel-nav\">\n    <li class=\"first active\"><a href=\"#\">Baby Dolphin</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Feeding Birds</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Tiger</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Zebra</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Sea Lion</a></li>\n    <li class=\"last\"><a href=\"#\">Discovery Cove</a></li>\n  </ol>\n  <div id=\"carousel-3-container\" class=\"carousel-container\">\n    <div class=\"carousel-nav-bar\">\n      <span class=\"carousel-prev\"></span>\n      <span class=\"carousel-next\"></span>\n      <span class=\"carousel-play-pause carousel-pause\"></span>\n    </div>\n    <ol class=\"carousel-content\">\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2181/3529457733_50200b99ab_m.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Dolphin\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3543/3514480796_2243d70d6b_m.jpg\" alt=\"Birds\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3306/3503294318_c34fab9d17_m.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3583/3530272148_4902b92aee_m.jpg\" alt=\"Zebra\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/3502485517_5d7a6fd6fa_m.jpg\" alt=\"Sealion2\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\n      <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3603/3513671837_9eef80c4ac_m.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Cove\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></li>\n     </ol>\n  </div>\n</div>  \n\n<p></code></p>\n\n<h2>Setting Up - Javascript</h2>  \n\n<p>The Javascript used in this article is extensive. If you get lost please take a look at the complete code as provided on GitHub. If you're still stuck, send me an email via <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/connect#contact\">my contact form</a></p>\n\n<h3>Step 1 - Basic Carousel Setup</h3>\n\n<p>The Carousel setup comes in two parts, and is different again to the previous articles (because variety is the spice of life, and because I'm still relatively new to Javascript and enjoy exploring different ways of doing things). In order to get the Carousel using custom navigation we will have to write several methods, so we will extend the YUI Carousel widget into our own widget which has these additional methods.</p>\n\n<p>To extend the carousel we need to first create a carousel object and then call extend with all of our additional properties and methods. The skeleton of this code is below with only the <kbd>init</kbd> method. We'll add more methods later.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"function(\">cc lang=\"javascript\"</a> {</p>\n\n<p>var YUD = YAHOO.util.Dom, \n      YUE = YAHOO.util.Event;</p>\n\n<p>YAHOO.namespace(\"ErisDS\");</p>\n\n<p>// Create custom version of the carousel\n  YAHOO.ErisDS.Carousel = function(el, oAttr) {</p>\n\n<pre><code>el = YUD.get(el);\n\noAttr = oAttr || {};\n\nif (el.id) {oAttr.id = el.id; }\nYAHOO.ErisDS.Carousel.superclass.constructor.call(this, el, oAttr); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>};</p>\n\n<p>//Make custom carousel extend the YUI Carousel &amp; start adding functionality\n  YAHOO.extend(YAHOO.ErisDS.Carousel, YAHOO.util.Element, {\n    container: null,\n    carousel: null,\n    init: function(el, oAttr) \n    {\n      this.container = el;\n      var carousel_container = YUD.getElementsByClassName('carousel-container', 'div', this.container)[0];</p>\n\n<pre><code>  // Setup the carousel and create pointers to the navigation\n  this.carousel = new YAHOO.widget.Carousel(carousel_container, oAttr);\n  this.nav = YUD.getElementsByClassName('carousel-nav', 'ol', this.container)[0];\n  this.nav_items = YUD.getChildren(this.nav);\n\n  //Draw the carousel and start it playing\n  this.carousel.render();\n  this.carousel.startAutoPlay();\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}); // end Extending Carousel\n})(); // end and call function\n[/cc]</p>\n\n<p>As well as setting up the Carousel itself and assigning it to a property, I have created variables that point to the navigation element and it's children. </p>\n\n<p>As always, we use onDomReady to ensure that nothing happens until the whole document is loaded.

The final <strong>Part 3</strong> will show you how to ditch the YUI navigation completely, so that you can use custom labels.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you read <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/code/yui-javascript-carousel-custom-navigation-part-1\"><strong>Part 1</strong></a> of this tutorial if you haven't already. If you want to follow along, then please setup your workspace with a basic HTML file and somewhere to put Javascript, CSS & images now, <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/yui-carousel-demo-2\">the demonstration page is here</a>. I'll be using the same images as last time, same rules apply! \r\n\r\n<h2>Getting Started - The HTML</h2>\r\nThe HTML for the carousel is the same as in <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/code/yui-javascript-carousel-custom-navigation-part-1\">Part 1</a>, except this time I have added titles to my images. Below I've only listed one carousel, but as you can see on the <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/yui-carousel-demo-2\">demonstration page</a>, the setup JavaScript we'll be writing later will detect multiple carousels on the page. To add another carousel just copy the HTML structure including the container div, change the id's but leave the classes intact.\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"html4strict\" tab=\"2\">\r\n<body class=\"carousel\">\r\n  <div id=\"my-carousel\" class=\"carousel-container\">\r\n    <ol class=\"carousel-content\">\r\n      <li>\r\n        <img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2181/3529457733_50200b99ab.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" alt=\"Baby Dolphin\" />\r\n        <h2>A Baby Dolphin called Bob</h2>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3543/3514480796_2243d70d6b.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\"alt=\"Birds\" />\r\n        <h2>Feeding the birds</h2>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3306/3503294318_c34fab9d17.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" alt=\"Tiger\" />\r\n        <h2>Up close and personal with a tiger</h2>  \r\n      </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </div>\r\n</body>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<h2>Referencing YUI</h2>\r\nYou'll need to add the same JavaScript references right above your closing body tag as last time. That is the link to the combined YUI scripts, plus your own setup JavaScript file. This time though, <strong>DON'T</strong> include the YUI CSS, just add a link to your own CSS file at the top of the page. So these are the includes you should have:\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"html4strict\" tab=\"2\">\r\n<head>\r\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/carousel.css\" />\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <!-- Content here -->\r\n\r\n  <script src=\"http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.7.0/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js&amp;2.7.0/build/element/element-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/animation/animation-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/carousel/carousel-min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n  <script src=\"js/carousel.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<h2>Setting up - Javascript</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 1 - Locate all carousel markup on the page</h3>\r\n<p>The first step is the same as last time, to setup our namespace and object literal. We still need an <kbd>init</kbd> function, and inside it we use the <kbd>getElementsByClassName</kbd> function to populate our <kbd>carousels</kbd> property with an array of all the elements which have the class <kbd>carousel-container</kbd>. We then loop over carousels and call a <kbd>setup</kbd> function on each element.\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"javascript\" tab=\"2\">\r\nYAHOO.namespace(\"ErisDS\");\r\nYAHOO.ErisDS.Carousel = {\r\n  carousels: '',\r\n  init: function()\r\n  {\r\n    this.carousels = YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('carousel-container');\r\n    for(i = 0; i < this.carousels.length; i++)\r\n    {\r\n      this.setup(this.carousels[i]);\r\n    }\r\n  }, ...\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 2 - Turn carousel markup into working carousels</h3>\r\n<p>Now we need to write our <kbd>setup</kbd> function. It takes the element that is to be a carousel as an argument. The body of the function contains the same setup code as our original <kbd>init</kbd> function from <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/code/yui-javascript-carousel-custom-navigation-part-1\">Part 1</a>, where the settings are explained.\r\n<code lang=\"javascript\" tab=\"2\">\r\n  setup: function(carousel_el)\r\n  {\r\n    var carousel = new YAHOO.widget.Carousel(carousel_el, \r\n    { \r\n      autoPlayInterval: 5000, \r\n      isCircular: true, \r\n      animation: {\r\n        speed: 1.0\r\n      }, \r\n      numVisible: 1\r\n    }); \r\n    carousel.render();\r\n    carousel.show();   \r\n    carousel.startAutoPlay();\r\n  }\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n</p><p>Finally, don't forget to call the function using <kbd>onDOMReady()</kbd>.</p>\r\n\r\n</code><code lang=\"javascript\" tab=\"2\">\r\nYAHOO.util.Event.onDOMReady(\r\n  function (ev) {\r\n      YAHOO.ErisDS.Carousel.init();\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<h2>Styling up - The Custom CSS</h2>\r\n</p><p>This time we aren't going to use the YUI CSS at all, so we will need to do quite a bit of work ourselves. First up I'll show you the bare minimum needed to get the carousel working. Then we will go through styling the navigation, and finally the customisations to get it looking the same as the demo page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Bare Minimum</h3>\r\n<p>To get the carousel working horizontally, we need to get all the items to display side-by-side. We then need to hide all but the item that should be visible using <kbd>overflow:hidden</kbd>. We also need to clear margins and padding, but we don't need to set any width or height - the carousel will just resize to fit the largest element inside of it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\">\r\n.carousel .carousel-container{\r\n  overflow: hidden;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel ol.carousel-content{\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  overflow: hidden;\r\n  width: 32000px;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel ol.carousel-content li{\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  float: left;\r\n  overflow: hidden;\r\n  *float: none;\r\n  *display: inline-block;\r\n  *zoom: 1;\r\n  *display: inline;\r\n} \r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/carousel-plain.jpg\" alt=\"Carousel Plain\" title=\"Carousel Plain\" width=\"300\" height=\"330\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-741\" />\r\n\r\n<p>I can hear people all over the interweb screaming \"nooooo!\" at the IE hacks. Feel free to move these to <a href=\"http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html\">conditional comments</a>, but for the purpose of tutorials using hacks makes it easier to show what I'm doing! All that extra code (plus the <kbd>position:relative</kbd>'s) is used to get IE6 & 7 to display the items side-by-side whilst still hiding all but the first item.</p>\r\n<p>On the right you can see how the carousel looks with just this basic styling - pretty nasty! Time to get creative. I want to get rid of the text in the navigation, put the navigation at the bottom, and add some nicer buttons<strong>*</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Navigation</h3>\r\n<p>Because I want to put the navigation at the bottom & have my carousel be fixed size, I need to set <kbd>width</kbd> and <kbd>height</kbd> on <kbd>carousel-container</kbd> and on the content <kbd>li</kbd>. I'm also going to add a <kbd>border</kbd> to contain the carousel. The following is the extra CSS I added.</p>\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\">\r\n.carousel .carousel-container{\r\n  width: 500px;\r\n  height: 364px;\r\n  border: 5px #451669 solid;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel ol.carousel-content li{\r\n  width: 500px;\r\n  height: 364px;\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>The following code uses <kbd>position:absolute</kbd> to move the navigation to the bottom. I've also added a semi-transparent background to the navigation bar, and used the <kbd>inline-block</kbd> hack again to get the <kbd>UL</kbd> to sit in the middle for all browsers. In the second part I have turned the navigation into circles using the CSS3 <kbd>border-radius</kbd> property (IE users will see squares) & gotten rid of the text with positioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\">\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav{\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  bottom: 0;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  right: 0;\r\n  z-index: 300;\r\n  width: 500px;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n  height: 31px;\r\n  line-height: 30px;\r\n  background: transparent url('../images/bg.png') top left repeat;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul{\r\n  margin: 5px 0;\r\n  padding: 0px;\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n  *display: inline;\r\n  zoom: 1;\r\n  vertical-align: middle;\r\n  list-style: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li{  \r\n  float: left;\r\n  height: 8px;\r\n  width: 8px;\r\n  background: #673191;\r\n  margin: 5px;\r\n  border: 1px solid #673191;\r\n  -moz-border-radius: 5px;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li a{\r\n  left: -10000px;\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li:hover, \r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li.hover, \r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li.yui-carousel-nav-page-selected {\r\n  background: #b6a2c4;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>Next let's replace those ugly buttons with something else. By setting the <kbd>width</kbd>, <kbd>height</kbd> and <kbd>padding</kbd> of the <kbd>button</kbd> we can hide it. Then I've added a background image to the <kbd>span</kbd>s and absolutely positioned them. I have also been adding hover states to all the navigation, but at the moment these will only work in browsers that support the <kbd>:hover</kbd> psuedo class on elements other than the <kbd>anchor</kbd> tag.</p>\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\">\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span{\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  bottom: 3px;\r\n  width: 25px;\r\n  height: 25px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span button, #carousel-2 .yui-carousel-nav span button:focus{\r\n  background: transparent;\r\n  border: none;\r\n  padding: 30px 0 0;\r\n  width: 25px;\r\n  height: 25px;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.yui-carousel-first-button{\r\n  left: 170px;\r\n  background: url('../images/prev-arrow.gif') no-repeat top left;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.yui-carousel-next-button{\r\n  right: 170px;\r\n  background: url('../images/next-arrow.gif') no-repeat top left;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.yui-carousel-first-button:hover,\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.prev-hover{\r\n  background: url('../images/prev-arrow-hover.gif') no-repeat top left;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.yui-carousel-next-button:hover,\r\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.next-hover{\r\n  background: url('../images/next-arrow-hover.gif') no-repeat top left;\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>We can fix the hover states for the previous and next buttons with some Javascript, but I haven't found a way to get this to work for the list navigation yet as it gets rewritten everytime the carousel changes and therefore it loses the listeners. To add listeners to the buttons, first add the following code to the end of your <kbd>init</kbd> function.</p>\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"javascript\" tab=\"2\">\r\n  var nav_buttons = YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('yui-carousel-button','span');\r\n  YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(nav_buttons,'mouseover',this.mouseover);\r\n  YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(nav_buttons,'mouseout',this.mouseout);\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, after the setup function add a comma, and then add the following two functions. All this does is add a <kbd>class</kbd> on mouseover and then remove it on mouseout, we use two different classes to make it easier to reference the buttons in IE6. This could be replaced with a sprite image & CSS that just changes the background position.</p>\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"javascript\" tab=\"2\">\r\n  mouseover: function(e)\r\n  {\r\n    \r\n    var add_target = YAHOO.util.Event.getTarget(e, false);\r\n\r\n    //add_target = YAHOO.util.Dom.getAncestorByTagName(target,'span');\r\n    if(YAHOO.util.Dom.hasClass(add_target, 'yui-carousel-next-button'))\r\n    {\r\n      YAHOO.util.Dom.addClass(add_target, 'next-hover');\r\n    } \r\n    else if(YAHOO.util.Dom.hasClass(add_target, 'yui-carousel-first-button'))\r\n    {\r\n      YAHOO.util.Dom.addClass(add_target, 'prev-hover');\r\n    } \r\n  },\r\n  mouseout: function(e)\r\n  {\r\n    var rem_target = YAHOO.util.Event.getTarget(e, false);\r\n    //rem_target = YAHOO.util.Dom.getAncestorByTagName(target,'span');\r\n    if(YAHOO.util.Dom.hasClass(rem_target, 'next-hover'))\r\n    {\r\n      YAHOO.util.Dom.removeClass(rem_target, 'next-hover');\r\n    } \r\n    else if(YAHOO.util.Dom.hasClass(rem_target, 'prev-hover')) \r\n    {\r\n      YAHOO.util.Dom.removeClass(rem_target, \"prev-hover\");\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<h3>Headings</h3>\r\n<p>That's it for the functionaliy. Here's the CSS I used to style my main heading. It's almost identical to the nav-bar code.</p>\r\n<code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\">\r\n.carousel ol.carousel-content li h2{\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  right: 0;\r\n  width: 500px;\r\n  z-index: 300;\r\n  line-height: 28px;\r\n  background: transparent url('../images/bg.png') top left repeat;\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n  margin: 0px;\r\n  padding: 5px;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/yui-carousel-demo-2\">On the demo page</a>, the two carousels are the same size and styled very similarly. However this is not necessary as you do not need to specifiy the size (the carousel will default to the size of the largest item within it) and you can also use <kbd>id</kbd>'s to style the two carousels entirely differently in the CSS, yet still use the same Javascript to make them work. However the functionality for the two carousels would remain the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well I think that's a wrap!  Not every single bit of CSS I used is here, but I will be providing all my files which I publish <strong>Part 3</strong> next week some time. Hope you've found this useful & reasonably easy to follow. Please drop any suggestions or ideas in the comments!</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"small\"><strong>*</strong> I said nicer, not amazing...

All that extra code (plus the <kbd>position:relative</kbd>'s) is used to get IE6 & 7 to display the items side-by-side whilst still hiding all but the first item.</p>  \n\n<p>On the right you can see how the carousel looks with just this basic styling - pretty nasty! Time to get creative. I want to get rid of the text in the navigation, put the navigation at the bottom, and add some nicer buttons<strong>*</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>The Navigation</h3>  \n\n<p>Because I want to put the navigation at the bottom & have my carousel be fixed size, I need to set <kbd>width</kbd> and <kbd>height</kbd> on <kbd>carousel-container</kbd> and on the content <kbd>li</kbd>. I'm also going to add a <kbd>border</kbd> to contain the carousel. The following is the extra CSS I added.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\"> <br />\n.carousel .carousel-container{\n  width: 500px;\n  height: 364px;\n  border: 5px #451669 solid;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel ol.carousel-content li{\n  width: 500px;\n  height: 364px;\n}\n</code></p>\n\n<p>The following code uses <kbd>position:absolute</kbd> to move the navigation to the bottom. I've also added a semi-transparent background to the navigation bar, and used the <kbd>inline-block</kbd> hack again to get the <kbd>UL</kbd> to sit in the middle for all browsers. In the second part I have turned the navigation into circles using the CSS3 <kbd>border-radius</kbd> property (IE users will see squares) & gotten rid of the text with positioning.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\"> <br />\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav{\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  z-index: 300;\n  width: 500px;\n  text-align: center;\n  height: 31px;\n  line-height: 30px;\n  background: transparent url('../images/bg.png') top left repeat;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul{\n  margin: 5px 0;\n  padding: 0px;\n  display: inline-block;\n  *display: inline;\n  zoom: 1;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  list-style: none;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li{ <br />\n  float: left;\n  height: 8px;\n  width: 8px;\n  background: #673191;\n  margin: 5px;\n  border: 1px solid #673191;\n  -moz-border-radius: 5px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li a{\n  left: -10000px;\n  position: absolute;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li:hover, \n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li.hover, \n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav ul li.yui-carousel-nav-page-selected {\n  background: #b6a2c4;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Next let's replace those ugly buttons with something else. By setting the <kbd>width</kbd>, <kbd>height</kbd> and <kbd>padding</kbd> of the <kbd>button</kbd> we can hide it. Then I've added a background image to the <kbd>span</kbd>s and absolutely positioned them. I have also been adding hover states to all the navigation, but at the moment these will only work in browsers that support the <kbd>:hover</kbd> psuedo class on elements other than the <kbd>anchor</kbd> tag.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\"> <br />\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span{\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: 3px;\n  width: 25px;\n  height: 25px;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span button, #carousel-2 .yui-carousel-nav span button:focus{\n  background: transparent;\n  border: none;\n  padding: 30px 0 0;\n  width: 25px;\n  height: 25px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.yui-carousel-first-button{\n  left: 170px;\n  background: url('../images/prev-arrow.gif') no-repeat top left;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.yui-carousel-next-button{\n  right: 170px;\n  background: url('../images/next-arrow.gif') no-repeat top left;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.yui-carousel-first-button:hover,\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.prev-hover{\n  background: url('../images/prev-arrow-hover.gif') no-repeat top left;\n}</p>\n\n<p>.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.yui-carousel-next-button:hover,\n.carousel .yui-carousel-nav span.next-hover{\n  background: url('../images/next-arrow-hover.gif') no-repeat top left;\n}\n</code></p>\n\n<p>We can fix the hover states for the previous and next buttons with some Javascript, but I haven't found a way to get this to work for the list navigation yet as it gets rewritten everytime the carousel changes and therefore it loses the listeners. To add listeners to the buttons, first add the following code to the end of your <kbd>init</kbd> function.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"javascript\" tab=\"2\"> <br />\n  var nav<em>buttons = YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('yui-carousel-button','span');\n  YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(nav</em>buttons,'mouseover',this.mouseover);\n  YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(nav_buttons,'mouseout',this.mouseout);\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Next, after the setup function add a comma, and then add the following two functions. All this does is add a <kbd>class</kbd> on mouseover and then remove it on mouseout, we use two different classes to make it easier to reference the buttons in IE6. This could be replaced with a sprite image & CSS that just changes the background position.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"javascript\" tab=\"2\"> <br />\n  mouseover: function(e)\n  {</p>\n\n<pre><code>var add_target = YAHOO.util.Event.getTarget(e, false);\n\n//add_target = YAHOO.util.Dom.getAncestorByTagName(target,'span');\nif(YAHOO.util.Dom.hasClass(add_target, 'yui-carousel-next-button'))\n{\n  YAHOO.util.Dom.addClass(add_target, 'next-hover');\n} \nelse if(YAHOO.util.Dom.hasClass(add_target, 'yui-carousel-first-button'))\n{\n  YAHOO.util.Dom.addClass(add_target, 'prev-hover');\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>},\n  mouseout: function(e)\n  {\n    var rem<em>target = YAHOO.util.Event.getTarget(e, false);\n    //rem</em>target = YAHOO.util.Dom.getAncestorByTagName(target,'span');\n    if(YAHOO.util.Dom.hasClass(rem<em>target, 'next-hover'))\n    {\n      YAHOO.util.Dom.removeClass(rem</em>target, 'next-hover');\n    } \n    else if(YAHOO.util.Dom.hasClass(rem<em>target, 'prev-hover')) \n    {\n      YAHOO.util.Dom.removeClass(rem</em>target, \"prev-hover\");\n    }\n  }\n</code></p>\n\n<h3>Headings</h3>  \n\n<p>That's it for the functionaliy. Here's the CSS I used to style my main heading. It's almost identical to the nav-bar code.</p>  \n\n<p><code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\"> <br />\n.carousel ol.carousel-content li h2{\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  width: 500px;\n  z-index: 300;\n  line-height: 28px;\n  background: transparent url('../images/bg.png') top left repeat;\n  color: #fff;\n  margin: 0px;\n  padding: 5px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n</code></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/yui-carousel-demo-2\">On the demo page</a>, the two carousels are the same size and styled very similarly. However this is not necessary as you do not need to specifiy the size (the carousel will default to the size of the largest item within it) and you can also use <kbd>id</kbd>'s to style the two carousels entirely differently in the CSS, yet still use the same Javascript to make them work. However the functionality for the two carousels would remain the same.</p>\n\n<p>Well I think that's a wrap!  Not every single bit of CSS I used is here, but I will be providing all my files which I publish <strong>Part 3</strong> next week some time. Hope you've found this useful & reasonably easy to follow. Please drop any suggestions or ideas in the comments!</p>\n\n<p class=\"small\"><strong>*</strong> I said nicer, not amazing...

I'm currently in the process of both learning *proper* JavaScript and trying to get to grips with the YUI framework. If you have suggestions for how to improve the following code I'd love to hear them.\r\n\r\nThe YUI Carousel widget is currently in Beta, and the navigation that it generates is very basic and, unlike the rest of the YUI framework, doesn't have the necessary CSS hooks to style it properly. This may change with the release of YUI 3.0, but the Carousel widget isn't included yet. So for the time being this <strong>three-part series</strong> will show you how to setup a Carousel &amp; build custom navigation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Part 1</strong> will go through the HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript needed to setup a basic carousel using the YUI default skin. In <strong><a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/code/yui-javascript-carousel-custom-navigation-part-2\">Part 2</a></strong> we'll remove the YUI skin and write our own, introduce multiple instances via class names and do some customisation to the carousel. Finally, in <strong>Part 3</strong> I'll go through all of the Javascript needed to write your own, completely custom navigation for the carousel.\r\n<h2>Getting Started - The HTML</h2>\r\nIf you want to follow along, then setup your workspace with a basic HTML file and somewhere to put Javascript, CSS &amp; images now. I'll be using some photos from my recent holiday, feel free to use these images for testing purposes, but please don't publish them as your own work! If you want to see the finished carousel in action, then please check out <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/yui-carousel-demo-1\">the demonstration page</a>.\r\n\r\nFirst we need to create the HTML list &amp; containers for our carousel along with some CSS classes for both reference and styling. This should include a container <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> (with class <kbd>carousel-container</kbd>) and an ordered list to contain our carousel items (class <kbd>carousel-content</kbd>). I have also added the classes <kbd>yui-skin-sam</kbd> and <kbd>carousel</kbd> to the body tag. Apart from those prefixed with \"yui\" all the classes I'm using are my own conventions and are not required by YUI.\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"html4strict\" tab=\"2\">\r\n<body class=\"yui-skin-sam carousel\">\r\n  <div id=\"my-carousel\" class=\"carousel-container\">\r\n    <ol class=\"carousel-content\">\r\n\t  <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3543/3514480796_2243d70d6b.jpg\" alt=\"Birds\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" /></li>\r\n\t  <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3306/3503294318_c34fab9d17.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" /></li>\r\n\t  <li><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3583/3530272148_4902b92aee.jpg\" alt=\"zebra\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" /></li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </div>\r\n</body>\r\n</code>\r\nThe <kbd>yui-skin-sam</kbd> class is a reference point for the YUI CSS so that the styling can be applied. For now I have added just three items to the list, and each one contains only an image. You can also include headers, paragraphs and any other HTML content to your carousel.\r\n<h2>Referencing YUI</h2>\r\nTo turn our numbered list of images into a carousel we need to include reference to the YUI CSS and Javascript. Unlike many other frameworks, rather than downloading a local copy of the framework, it is normal to reference YUI direct from the Yahoo! Servers using the <a title=\"YUI Dependency Configurator\" href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/\">YUI Dependency Configurator</a> to work out which files you need. For now I will show you which files to add:\r\n\r\nWe are going to need the carousel.css file to style the list properly. Add the following stylesheet link to the head of your HTML file.\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"html4strict\" tab=\"2\">\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.7.0/build/carousel/assets/skins/sam/carousel.css\" /> \r\n</code>\r\nIn order for the Carousel to work properly, we will need the YUI Dom collection &amp; Event utilities, the Element utility (which provides an object to represent HTML elements), the animation utility and finally, the carousel component. They are minimised and combined by YUI and served to you as a single file. YUI is an unobtrusive framework, so add the following lines of HTML to the very bottom of your page just above the <kbd>&lt;/body&gt;</kbd> tag.\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"html4strict\" tab=\"2\">\r\n<script src=\"http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.7.0/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js&amp;2.7.0/build/element/element-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/animation/animation-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/carousel/carousel-min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n</code>\r\n<h2>Setting up - Javascript</h2>\r\nNow with all of the framework components in place, we can go about the work of setting up our carousel. For now we will do this by getting the id of the carousel's wrapping <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd>, but in <strong>Part II</strong> we will create the carousel based on class name so that we might have multiple instances. \r\n\r\nCreate a file called carousel.js in a Javascript folder, and link to it after the YUI scripts so it appears something like this:\r\n<code lang=\"html4strict\" tab=\"2\">\r\n<script src=\"js/carousel.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nBe aware that we create an instance of the carousel by passing in the <strong>id of the containing <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd></strong>, not the ordered list. We also need to pass in a set of properties which are explained below. I have made our carousel variable into a property of our object so that we can easily have reference from additional methods of our object when we add more functionality later.\r\n\r\nOnce we have setup our carousel instance, we call <kbd>render</kbd>, <kbd>show</kbd>, and <kbd>startAutoPlay</kbd> to setup, display &amp; start the carousel. Of course none of this happens until the <kbd>init</kbd> method is called. As YUI is non-intrusive the methods to setup the carousel are called after the page has finished loading using <kbd>onDomReady</kbd>. I have added a test to the <kbd>onDomReady</kbd> function to ensure that the carousel id exists before we try using it to create an instance of the carousel widget.\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"javascript\" tab=\"2\">\r\n//Setup a namespace to contain your own code within the YAHOO namespace\r\nYAHOO.namespace(\"ErisDS\");\r\n\r\n//Create our carousel object literal with an init method\r\nYAHOO.ErisDS.Carousel = {\r\n  carousel: '',\r\n  init: function()\r\n  {\r\n    this.carousel = new YAHOO.widget.Carousel(\"my-carousel\", \r\n    { \r\n      autoPlayInterval: 5000, \r\n      isCircular: true, \r\n      animation: {\r\n        speed: 0.5\r\n      }, \r\n      numVisible: 1\r\n\t  }); \r\n    \r\n    this.carousel.render();\r\n    this.carousel.show();   // display the widget\r\n    this.carousel.startAutoPlay();\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\n//onDomReady check to see if our carousel exists, and call the setup function\r\nYAHOO.util.Event.onDOMReady(\r\n  function (ev) {\r\n    if(YAHOO.util.Dom.get(\"my-carousel\"))\r\n    {\r\n      YAHOO.ErisDS.Carousel.init();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n</code>\r\nCopy the code above into your Javascript file. You should now have a working carousel.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Properties</h3>\r\n\r\n<dl> <dt>autoPlayInterval: 5000</dt> <dd>How many milliseconds between transitions (i.e. 5 seconds)</dd> <dt>isCircular: true </dt> <dd>Previous &amp; next button are always active as when the carousel gets to the last item it carries on back to the first.</dd> <dt>animation: { speed: 1.0 }</dt> <dd>How long it takes for a transition from one item to the next to complete. 1.0 is one second.</dd> <dt>numVisible: 1 </dt> <dd>How many items are visible at any one time.</dd> </dl>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The configuration attribute used to make the YUI Carousel autoplay changed somewhere between YUI 2.6 &amp; 2.7 from <kbd>autoPlay</kbd>, to <kbd>autoPlayInterval</kbd>. It works the same way, but there is no backwards compatibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tidying up - A little Custom CSS</h2>\r\n\r\nDepending on your browser and any other CSS you have present on the page your carousel may have some spacing which makes it look untidy. The following CSS is designed to ensure the carousel fits snug around the images and looks smart.\r\n\r\n<code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\">\r\n#my-carousel .carousel-container{\r\nwidth: 500px;\r\nheight: 364px;\r\nmargin: 0px auto;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#my-carousel ol.carousel-content{\r\nmargin:0px;\r\npadding: 0px;\r\nlist-style: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#my-carousel ol.carousel-content li{\r\nmargin:0px;\r\npadding: 0px;\r\nwidth: 500px;\r\nheight: 364px;\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/yui-carousel-demo-i\">finished article is basically an image slideshow</a>.  In the next part we will drop the YUI CSS and customise the carousel and navigation.

YUI is an unobtrusive framework, so add the following lines of HTML to the very bottom of your page just above the <kbd>&lt;/body&gt;</kbd> tag.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"html4strict\" tab=\"2\">  </p>\n\n<script src=\"http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.7.0/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js&amp;2.7.0/build/element/element-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/animation/animation-min.js&amp;2.7.0/build/carousel/carousel-min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>  \n\n<p></code>  </p>\n\n<h2>Setting up - Javascript</h2>  \n\n<p>Now with all of the framework components in place, we can go about the work of setting up our carousel. For now we will do this by getting the id of the carousel's wrapping <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd>, but in <strong>Part II</strong> we will create the carousel based on class name so that we might have multiple instances. </p>\n\n<p>Create a file called carousel.js in a Javascript folder, and link to it after the YUI scripts so it appears something like this: <br />\n<code lang=\"html4strict\" tab=\"2\">  </p>\n\n<script src=\"js/carousel.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>  \n\n<p></code></p>\n\n<p>Be aware that we create an instance of the carousel by passing in the <strong>id of the containing <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd></strong>, not the ordered list. We also need to pass in a set of properties which are explained below. I have made our carousel variable into a property of our object so that we can easily have reference from additional methods of our object when we add more functionality later.</p>\n\n<p>Once we have setup our carousel instance, we call <kbd>render</kbd>, <kbd>show</kbd>, and <kbd>startAutoPlay</kbd> to setup, display &amp; start the carousel. Of course none of this happens until the <kbd>init</kbd> method is called. As YUI is non-intrusive the methods to setup the carousel are called after the page has finished loading using <kbd>onDomReady</kbd>. I have added a test to the <kbd>onDomReady</kbd> function to ensure that the carousel id exists before we try using it to create an instance of the carousel widget.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"javascript\" tab=\"2\"> <br />\n//Setup a namespace to contain your own code within the YAHOO namespace\nYAHOO.namespace(\"ErisDS\");</p>\n\n<p>//Create our carousel object literal with an init method\nYAHOO.ErisDS.Carousel = { <br />\n  carousel: '',\n  init: function()\n  {\n    this.carousel = new YAHOO.widget.Carousel(\"my-carousel\", \n    { \n      autoPlayInterval: 5000, \n      isCircular: true, \n      animation: {\n        speed: 0.5\n      }, \n      numVisible: 1\n      }); </p>\n\n<pre><code>this.carousel.render();\nthis.carousel.show();   // display the widget\nthis.carousel.startAutoPlay();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}\n};</p>\n\n<p>//onDomReady check to see if our carousel exists, and call the setup function\nYAHOO.util.Event.onDOMReady( <br />\n  function (ev) {\n    if(YAHOO.util.Dom.get(\"my-carousel\"))\n    {\n      YAHOO.ErisDS.Carousel.init();\n    }\n  }\n);\n</code> <br />\nCopy the code above into your Javascript file. You should now have a working carousel.</p>\n\n<h3>The Properties</h3>\n\n<dl> <dt>autoPlayInterval: 5000</dt> <dd>How many milliseconds between transitions (i.e. 5 seconds)</dd> <dt>isCircular: true </dt> <dd>Previous &amp; next button are always active as when the carousel gets to the last item it carries on back to the first.</dd> <dt>animation: { speed: 1.0 }</dt> <dd>How long it takes for a transition from one item to the next to complete. 1.0 is one second.</dd> <dt>numVisible: 1 </dt> <dd>How many items are visible at any one time.</dd> </dl>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The configuration attribute used to make the YUI Carousel autoplay changed somewhere between YUI 2.6 &amp; 2.7 from <kbd>autoPlay</kbd>, to <kbd>autoPlayInterval</kbd>. It works the same way, but there is no backwards compatibility.</p>\n\n<h2>Tidying up - A little Custom CSS</h2>\n\n<p>Depending on your browser and any other CSS you have present on the page your carousel may have some spacing which makes it look untidy. The following CSS is designed to ensure the carousel fits snug around the images and looks smart.</p>\n\n<p><code lang=\"css\" tab=\"2\">  </p>\n\n<h1 id=\"mycarouselcarouselcontainer\">my-carousel .carousel-container{</h1>\n\n<p>width: 500px; <br />\nheight: 364px; <br />\nmargin: 0px auto; <br />\n}</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"mycarouselolcarouselcontent\">my-carousel ol.carousel-content{</h1>\n\n<p>margin:0px; <br />\npadding: 0px; <br />\nlist-style: none; <br />\n}</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"mycarouselolcarouselcontentli\">my-carousel ol.carousel-content li{</h1>\n\n<p>margin:0px; <br />\npadding: 0px; <br />\nwidth: 500px; <br />\nheight: 364px; <br />\n}\n</code></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/resources/yui-carousel-demo-i\">finished article is basically an image slideshow</a>.

I often need to build sites that have a quote/testimonial or banner image tied to individual pages &amp; displayed in the template separately to <kbd>\"the_content()\"</kbd>. This is fine in Wordpress as long as it remains a one-to-one relationship as it can easily be achieved with <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Custom_Fields\">custom fields</a> (and check out the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-fields/\">More Fields</a> plugin for handling this), but achieving a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship in Wordpress requires some more dramatic extension.</p>\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge there are two plugins for doing this. <a href=\"http://flutter.freshout.us/\">Flutter</a> and <a href=\"http://pods.uproot.us/\">Pods</a>.\r\n<h3>Flutter</h3>\r\nI started out using Flutter as I hadn't heard of Pods but found it to be clunky, buggy &amp; unintuitive. When editing a content type (or write panel) created by Flutter it looks as though you are in the Post or Page section depending on where you placed your new content type. This is confusing and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe data types provided with Flutter are quite extensive (it even includes a colour picker). However, Flutter's image upload control is buggy and I have experienced Flutter jumping to the wrong page, crashing Firefox and losing data. All-in-all I found it to be hard to use, missing key features and lacking documentation which meant I needed something else.\r\n<h3>Pods</h3>\r\nIn essence what Pods does is turn Wordpress into Drupal. It allows you to define your own content types with multiple fields for adding data so that you can use Wordpress' admin interface and templating system to manage whatever data you want, be it just additional testimonials, or a full-blown product database. It also allows you to define templates for displaying or listing data types &amp; to write helpers and filters to handle the entry and display of complex data.\r\n\r\nPods' integration into Wordpress is much cleaner, meaning that content editing is much more intuitive than in Flutter. The many options for configuring filters and helpers has lead to a slightly complex admin interface, but one that is still highly usable. Pods also has considerably more documentation than Flutter seems to, although it is still lacking in some areas.\r\n\r\nFor me, the key bit of functionality which has made me love Pods is the PICK data type. It is essentially a drop-down list control, but instead of requiring you to define the options, it allows you to choose to list out other Pods, or Wordpress objects such as Posts, Pages or Users. This means you can build relationships between your content items, and that you create blocks of content for your templates by linking pods to Posts or Pages.\r\n\r\nOne piece of functionality I needed but isn't present is the ability to use a PICK to create a drop-down list of all Posts and Pages to choose one to link to. A PICK data type can currently only list out Pages OR Posts OR Users etc, but not both. It is also not possible to list out Attachments, despite them being stored in the same table as Posts and pages.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pods-pick.jpg\"><img class=\"align-left\" title=\"Pods PICK interface (modified)\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pods-pick.jpg\" alt=\"Pods PICK interface (modified)\" width=\"280\" height=\"311\" /></a>As I needed this functionality, I decided to implement it. I have added the ability to PICK from Attachments, Posts &amp; Pages, Posts &amp; Attachments, Pages &amp; Attachments, or Posts, Pages &amp; Attachments. Only two files were modified  (<kbd>manage_pods.php</kbd> to add options to the select, and <kbd>Pods.class.php</kbd> to extend the if/else and SQL statements to choose the right data).\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use my modified version of the Pods plugin, I have made it available for download. Please first download the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pods/\">full Pods plugin</a> and install it.

I often need to build sites that have a quote/testimonial or banner image tied to individual pages &amp; displayed in the template separately to <kbd>\"the_content()\"</kbd>. This is fine in Wordpress as long as it remains a one-to-one relationship as it can easily be achieved with <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Custom_Fields\">custom fields</a> (and check out the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-fields/\">More Fields</a> plugin for handling this), but achieving a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship in Wordpress requires some more dramatic extension.</p>\n\n<p>To my knowledge there are two plugins for doing this. <a href=\"http://flutter.freshout.us/\">Flutter</a> and <a href=\"http://pods.uproot.us/\">Pods</a>.  </p>\n\n<h3>Flutter</h3>  \n\n<p>I started out using Flutter as I hadn't heard of Pods but found it to be clunky, buggy &amp; unintuitive. When editing a content type (or write panel) created by Flutter it looks as though you are in the Post or Page section depending on where you placed your new content type. This is confusing and unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>The data types provided with Flutter are quite extensive (it even includes a colour picker). However, Flutter's image upload control is buggy and I have experienced Flutter jumping to the wrong page, crashing Firefox and losing data. All-in-all I found it to be hard to use, missing key features and lacking documentation which meant I needed something else.  </p>\n\n<h3>Pods</h3>  \n\n<p>In essence what Pods does is turn Wordpress into Drupal. It allows you to define your own content types with multiple fields for adding data so that you can use Wordpress' admin interface and templating system to manage whatever data you want, be it just additional testimonials, or a full-blown product database. It also allows you to define templates for displaying or listing data types &amp; to write helpers and filters to handle the entry and display of complex data.</p>\n\n<p>Pods' integration into Wordpress is much cleaner, meaning that content editing is much more intuitive than in Flutter. The many options for configuring filters and helpers has lead to a slightly complex admin interface, but one that is still highly usable. Pods also has considerably more documentation than Flutter seems to, although it is still lacking in some areas.</p>\n\n<p>For me, the key bit of functionality which has made me love Pods is the PICK data type. It is essentially a drop-down list control, but instead of requiring you to define the options, it allows you to choose to list out other Pods, or Wordpress objects such as Posts, Pages or Users. This means you can build relationships between your content items, and that you create blocks of content for your templates by linking pods to Posts or Pages.</p>\n\n<p>One piece of functionality I needed but isn't present is the ability to use a PICK to create a drop-down list of all Posts and Pages to choose one to link to. A PICK data type can currently only list out Pages OR Posts OR Users etc, but not both. It is also not possible to list out Attachments, despite them being stored in the same table as Posts and pages.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pods-pick.jpg\"><img class=\"align-left\" title=\"Pods PICK interface (modified)\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pods-pick.jpg\" alt=\"Pods PICK interface (modified)\" width=\"280\" height=\"311\" /></a>As I needed this functionality, I decided to implement it. I have added the ability to PICK from Attachments, Posts &amp; Pages, Posts &amp; Attachments, Pages &amp; Attachments, or Posts, Pages &amp; Attachments. Only two files were modified  (<kbd>manage_pods.php</kbd> to add options to the select, and <kbd>Pods.class.php</kbd> to extend the if/else and SQL statements to choose the right data).</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to use my modified version of the Pods plugin, I have made it available for download. Please first download the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pods/\">full Pods plugin</a> and install it. Then download the <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/podsmodified.zip\">podsmodified</a> and upload them to the <kbd>wp-content/plugins/pods/core</kbd> folder.

If you have ever looked at visiting Discovery Cove and thought the price was over-the-top, take it from me, it isn't. I just got back from my day at Discovery Cove and I couldn't recommend it any more highly.\r\n\r\nDiscovery Cove is not like any other theme park in Florida, spaces are limited, so you have to make reservations. This means that there are considerably less people than in an ordinary theme park and as it is also quite a small park, it feels very private. None of this prepared us for the wonderes we experienced today.\r\n\r\nFirst up when we arrived for 8am check-in, they were experiencing computer problems which meant they were checking everyone in by hand. Waiting for this was no bore, as the Discovery Cove staff kept us entertained by bringing out some of the animals including an Owl, a Parrot, a Sloth and an Armadillo! After having a \"meet n greet\" with practically every member of staff we got stuck in to breakfast (included) which was more than adequate for excited bellies!\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Discovery Cove Dolphins by erisds, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/erisds/3513671983/\"><img class=\"align-right\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3592/3513671983_29922368b7_m.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Cove Dolphins\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a>Discovery Cove provides either a vest or full wet suit, a snorkel &amp; mask (you get to keep the snorkel if you wish), and special sunscreen which isn't harmful to animals.

If you have ever looked at visiting Discovery Cove and thought the price was over-the-top, take it from me, it isn't. I just got back from my day at Discovery Cove and I couldn't recommend it any more highly.</p>\n\n<p>Discovery Cove is not like any other theme park in Florida, spaces are limited, so you have to make reservations. This means that there are considerably less people than in an ordinary theme park and as it is also quite a small park, it feels very private. None of this prepared us for the wonderes we experienced today.</p>\n\n<p>First up when we arrived for 8am check-in, they were experiencing computer problems which meant they were checking everyone in by hand. Waiting for this was no bore, as the Discovery Cove staff kept us entertained by bringing out some of the animals including an Owl, a Parrot, a Sloth and an Armadillo! After having a \"meet n greet\" with practically every member of staff we got stuck in to breakfast (included) which was more than adequate for excited bellies!</p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Discovery Cove Dolphins by erisds, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/erisds/3513671983/\"><img class=\"align-right\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3592/3513671983_29922368b7_m.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Cove Dolphins\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a>Discovery Cove provides either a vest or full wet suit, a snorkel &amp; mask (you get to keep the snorkel if you wish), and special sunscreen which isn't harmful to animals.

I've got plans to write several articles and tutorials on it, but as I know many people haven't yet heard of it, or are unaware of how it could help them, I thought it best to write an introductory article. So, here is an explanation of what Symfony is, why I use it, and why <em>you</em> may want to start using it too.\r\n\r\nSymfony is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php_framework#PHP\">PHP framework</a>. It is a large volume of extremely useful bits of code written in PHP and collected together under a common name, with lots of documentation and a set of additional tools to make web development easier, faster and safer! It aims to make the life of a developer much, much simpler.\r\n<h3>What does Symfony do?</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Drastically reduce the <strong>amount of code</strong> written</li>\r\n\t<li>Vastly reduce <strong>development time</strong></li>\r\n\t<li>Improve the <strong>standard of coding</strong> in web apps</li>\r\n\t<li>Not reinvent the wheel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSymfony contains a vast quantity of code needed to get any database-driven web application up and running, along with several tools to automate common tasks. A developer only has to specify the data model/structures which are needed for her application in a special format called <a title=\"YAML Ain't Markup Language\" href=\"http://www.yaml.org/\">YAML</a>, then Symfony will build the database tables and create all the classes needed to access and retrieve the data as objects along with basic templates and forms for viewing and entering the data. Symfony also has an admin generator, meaning it is capable of building a complete administration system for the data. The amount of code written by the developer is minimised, and the development time is significantly reduced.\r\n\r\nSymfony follows the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern</a> and is completely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Oriented\">Object Oriented</a>. This means the code is organised, flexible, and extensible - if Symfony doesn't work the way you want it to, you always have the option to override the functionality. Developers are encouraged to follow the patterns and best practices used in Symfony in their own code, thus improving the overall standard of coding.\r\n\r\nWhat Symfony doesn't do, is reinvent the wheel - it makes use of already proven tools where possible. For example Symfony supports either <a href=\"http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/\">Propel</a> or <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/\">Doctrine</a> as the <a title=\"Object-Relational Mapping\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping\">ORM</a> layer (for interacting with the database - I use Propel) and uses <a title=\"PHing Is Not Gnu make\" href=\"http://phing.info/trac/\">Phing</a> for building projects. Functionality like search or sending mail is not included in the Symfony framework, instead there are plugins in the extensive plugin library and tutorials on how to include popular libraries from the Zend framework. This keeps Symfony lightweight and focused on what it does best, meanwhile developers have the flexibility to use their favourite tools rather than \"what's in the box\".\r\n<h3>So what does the developer do?</h3>\r\nSymfony does a great deal of the groundwork of setting up a web application, but it can only do so much. Because the code to create, edit, list and show the data is generated by Symfony from the data model, the resulting display and functionality is very generic. The developer then has the job of building templates, configuring forms, modifying data, and implementing advanced functionality.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/tutorial/1_2/my-first-project\">My First Symfony Project</a> tutorial takes you through the basics of setting up a blog. After defining the data model for blog posts &amp; comments and generating the <abbr title=\"Create, Read, Update and Delete\">CRUD</abbr> code, the list view, which would effectively be the blog's index page, looks like this:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/tutorial/1_2/my-first-project\"><img class=\"align-left\" title=\"My First Symfony Project\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/myfirstsymfonyproject.gif\" alt=\"My First Symfony Project\" width=\"600\" height=\"167\" /></a>\r\n\r\nClearly, this looks nothing like a traditional blog. The ID and body don't need to be displayed, the title should link to the \"single\" view, there is no indication of how many comments each post has and the created at date needs to be formatted to be more human-friendly. There are also many features missing such as searching, RSS feeds, categories, tags and user profiles. The additional features, data formatting and the HTML + CSS templates all need to be implemented by the developer, so there is still plenty of work to do.\r\n<h3>What is Symfony good at?</h3>\r\nSymfony is excellent for building any website which features content management or web services. The ability to specify data models (or content types if you want to think of it that way) and get the basic  <abbr title=\"Create, Read, Update and Delete\">CRUD</abbr> functionality up and running quickly, means that small content management systems can be a breeze to build. In addition to this, Symfony follows a <a title=\"Representational State Transfer\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\">RESTful architecture</a> and has a very extensive and flexible routing system for building URLs. This means creating pretty URLs is simple, and providing web services via specific URLs is also easy to do (think twitter feeds being provided at http://twitter.com/username).\r\n\r\nThe more I learn about Symfony, the more I love it. I'm using it to build all those little personal projects that I would otherwise never have time to complete due to the overhead of time required to get the simplest function (data handling, pretty URLs, user management) working from scratch. I also find that working with Symfony gives me a greater sense of satisfaction because I feel that the code I am producing is of a higher standard and much more reliable. I thoroughly recommend trying it out, even if you just run through the tutorials and pick up some good programming practices.\r\n<h3>So what next?</h3>\r\nSymfony does have quite a steep learning curve, and if you're planning to get started, there are a few things that you will need to be comfortable with first:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Oriented\">Object Oriented Programming principles</a> (objects, data abstraction, inheritance etc)</li>\r\n\t<li>Basic PHP, SQL and database management knowledge</li>\r\n\t<li>Development environment setup &amp; management (virtual hosts, symlinks etc)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou don't need to be an expert or even proficient in these things, but arming yourself with knowledge of these tools will not only ease your journey with Symfony, but will also improve your overall experience with programming, scripting and development tasks. I really recommend a little background reading!\r\n\r\nOnce you are ready to put your best foot forward and give Symfony a go, then the only way to get started is with a tutorial. Dive in with the <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/tutorial/1_2/my-first-project\">My First Symfony Project</a> tutorial, and then move on to the <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_2/Propel/en/\">Jobeet</a> job board tutorial, which is much more in depth and shows you how to put into practice some of the more advanced features. There is plenty of other material to help you get started, including the <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/doc/1_2/\">documentation &amp; API</a>, the <a href=\"http://forum.symfony-project.org/\">forums</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/\">blog</a>, the <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/symfony/planet\">outside blogs RSS feed</a>, the <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-users\">google users group</a> and of course, <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/tag/snippet\">my snippet library</a>!\r\n\r\nI hope that this article has explained what Symfony is all about and also whet your appetite for learning it. If there is anything else you want to know, or feel could be added to improve this introduction, please drop me a line in the comments. Otherwise I wish you good luck on your journey with Symfony, let me know how you get on!","html":"<p><a href=\"http://symfony-project.org\"><img class=\"align-right\" title=\"Symfony Project Homepage\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/symfony.jpg\" alt=\"Symfony Project Homepage\" width=\"320\" height=\"350\" /></a><a href=\"http://symfony-project.org\">Symfony</a> is one of my favourite bits of technology.

After defining the data model for blog posts &amp; comments and generating the <abbr title=\"Create, Read, Update and Delete\">CRUD</abbr> code, the list view, which would effectively be the blog's index page, looks like this: <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/tutorial/1_2/my-first-project\"><img class=\"align-left\" title=\"My First Symfony Project\" src=\"http://erisds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/myfirstsymfonyproject.gif\" alt=\"My First Symfony Project\" width=\"600\" height=\"167\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Clearly, this looks nothing like a traditional blog. The ID and body don't need to be displayed, the title should link to the \"single\" view, there is no indication of how many comments each post has and the created at date needs to be formatted to be more human-friendly. There are also many features missing such as searching, RSS feeds, categories, tags and user profiles. The additional features, data formatting and the HTML + CSS templates all need to be implemented by the developer, so there is still plenty of work to do.  </p>\n\n<h3>What is Symfony good at?</h3>  \n\n<p>Symfony is excellent for building any website which features content management or web services. The ability to specify data models (or content types if you want to think of it that way) and get the basic  <abbr title=\"Create, Read, Update and Delete\">CRUD</abbr> functionality up and running quickly, means that small content management systems can be a breeze to build. In addition to this, Symfony follows a <a title=\"Representational State Transfer\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\">RESTful architecture</a> and has a very extensive and flexible routing system for building URLs. This means creating pretty URLs is simple, and providing web services via specific URLs is also easy to do (think twitter feeds being provided at <a href='http://twitter.com/username'>http://twitter.com/username</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The more I learn about Symfony, the more I love it. I'm using it to build all those little personal projects that I would otherwise never have time to complete due to the overhead of time required to get the simplest function (data handling, pretty URLs, user management) working from scratch. I also find that working with Symfony gives me a greater sense of satisfaction because I feel that the code I am producing is of a higher standard and much more reliable. I thoroughly recommend trying it out, even if you just run through the tutorials and pick up some good programming practices.  </p>\n\n<h3>So what next?</h3>  \n\n<p>Symfony does have quite a steep learning curve, and if you're planning to get started, there are a few things that you will need to be comfortable with first:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n    <li>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Oriented\">Object Oriented Programming principles</a> (objects, data abstraction, inheritance etc)</li>\n    <li>Basic PHP, SQL and database management knowledge</li>\n    <li>Development environment setup &amp; management (virtual hosts, symlinks etc)</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>You don't need to be an expert or even proficient in these things, but arming yourself with knowledge of these tools will not only ease your journey with Symfony, but will also improve your overall experience with programming, scripting and development tasks. I really recommend a little background reading!</p>\n\n<p>Once you are ready to put your best foot forward and give Symfony a go, then the only way to get started is with a tutorial. Dive in with the <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/tutorial/1_2/my-first-project\">My First Symfony Project</a> tutorial, and then move on to the <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_2/Propel/en/\">Jobeet</a> job board tutorial, which is much more in depth and shows you how to put into practice some of the more advanced features. There is plenty of other material to help you get started, including the <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/doc/1_2/\">documentation &amp; API</a>, the <a href=\"http://forum.symfony-project.org/\">forums</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/\">blog</a>, the <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/symfony/planet\">outside blogs RSS feed</a>, the <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/symfony-users\">google users group</a> and of course, <a href=\"http://erisds.co.uk/tag/snippet\">my snippet library</a>!</p>\n\n<p>I hope that this article has explained what Symfony is all about and also whet your appetite for learning it. If there is anything else you want to know, or feel could be added to improve this introduction, please drop me a line in the comments. Otherwise I wish you good luck on your journey with Symfony, let me know how you get on!</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1382037746460,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1382037746460,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1240759200000,"published_by":1},{"id":106,"uuid":"0856c6aa-fee6-415e-b41b-f978e97a71e5","title":"Disneyland, here I come!","slug":"disneyland-here-i-come","markdown":"Two weeks ago, my slightly better half had his 30th birthday.

This means continuing to develop websites which support IE6 even in a slightly downgraded fashion, but it also means pointing clients towards a future without IE6 and guiding them them through this transition by removing all reliance on it.

All of these companies are aware that these technologies will be phased out eventually and should have plans in place to upgrade their systems, but again it's not our place to force these changes.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft are now <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/04/10/prepare-for-automatic-update-distribution-of-ie8.aspx\">pushing IE8 through automatic updates</a> and will <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/?sort=PN&amp;alpha=Windows+2000&amp;Filter=FilterNO\">cease support for Windows 2k in July next year</a> - with this I can see the lifespan of IE6 finally drawing to a close. With the death of the OS which supports only the abominable IE6, it will be feasible for Microsoft to finally cease supporting IE6 too. When Microsoft say IE6 is dead, and only then, will IE6 really start to die - so the web design community needs to stop wasting it's breath on users who can't do anything about it - and tell it to Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p>For now IE6 is still here and web folk still need to do their jobs. This means continuing to develop websites which support IE6 even in a slightly downgraded fashion, but it also means pointing clients towards a future without IE6 and guiding them them through this transition by removing all reliance on it. Cheer up, just think of all the work that will come flying in when IE6 does die.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1382037746464,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1382037746464,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1239579547000,"published_by":1},{"id":112,"uuid":"aaf46ea8-0b17-43f6-88f4-847a3e1fc3f2","title":"Snippet: Symfony Forms - Setting Default Values","slug":"snippet-symfony-forms-setting-default-values","markdown":"<p>I often forget how to set default values for form fields.
